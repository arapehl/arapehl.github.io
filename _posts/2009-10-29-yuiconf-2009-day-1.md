What a week! As a new yahoo I attended orientation on Monday and Tuesday, and now I&#8217;m enjoying the [first annual YUICONF][1]. Late last night [Christian Heilmann][2] asked if I could contribute my impressions of the conference&#8217;s first day which was just [posted to the YDN blog][3]. Happy reading!

What I didn&#8217;t mention in the blog post is that so far, this week has been close to surreal. Forget that I&#8217;ve been on the Yahoo! HQ campus as a fully carded yahoo for three days. That itself is pinch-me worthy. But it&#8217;s been fanboy heaven. I&#8217;ve met Tom Croucher, Isaac Schlueter, Adam Moore, Matt Sweeney, Lucas Smith, Stoyan Stefanov, Satyen Desai, Philip Tellis and I shook Doug Crockford&#8217;s hand! Yes, I&#8217;m a shameless fanboy, and I don&#8217;t care! :-)
