[*Continued from Day 4. Stranded*][1]

*Alright, all I have to do is find a way to send a message to the future. Something that&#8217;ll last 65 million years. Maybe I can etch something into the bedrock. Instructions on how to get me ba&#8211;*

A blinding light disoriented and enveloped him. He began falling. His whole body tingled and not a good tingling at that. His head began spinning and his stomach turned.

*What the&#8230;*

As instantly as it began, it was over. He was laying on his side. The ground didn&#8217;t feel like dirt. Where was he? His face was against something smooth and cold. Was it a floor tile?

*What just happened?*

He slowly opened his eyes. He could hear the familiar hum of lab equipment. Everything looked fuzzy. His eyes were adjusting.

&#8220;Welcome back, Doctor,&#8221; came a voice beyond his range of vision. He tried focusing on it. His eyes still struggling against the intensity of the light. His head began to throb.

&#8220;Too bright,&#8221; he managed.

&#8220;Turn down those lights,&#8221; the voice commanded.

It took his eyes a few moments to adjust, but he could finally see properly. Standing a few feet from him were two men. Well, a man and a teenager. Several feet behind them were what looked like military personnel and lab workers. They&#8217;d all stopped what they were doing and were presently staring. He slowly rose to his feet and addressed the man, &#8220;thank you.&#8221;

&#8220;It took us a while to figure out your setup. But once we did, zeroing in on your previous coordinates was pretty easy. Name&#8217;s Kyle by the way. Kyle Johnson,&#8221; he said, extending a hand, &#8220;and this fella next to me is Rock Gagnon.&#8221;

&#8220;What&#8217;s the date?&#8221;

&#8220;December twenty-second, twenty-ten.&#8221;

He quickly did the math. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been gone four years!?&#8221;

&#8220;Well, yes and no. It&#8217;s been four years here in our time stream. But we pulled you back from the moment you materialized in the past. So for you it&#8217;s been a few seconds at most.&#8221;

&#8220;So it took you four years to figure out how to get me back?&#8221;

&#8220;Actually no, Rock and I have been on base for only about a week now. I spent a few days with him on a different project. We&#8217;ve only been working on getting you back for about two days,&#8221; Kyle replied with a grin.
