*[Continued from Day 12. Career Change][1]*

It was two hour past midnight. The cavernous restaurant was dimly lit and only hosting one patron at the moment. He sat alone at his table slowly working through a medium rare Wagyu ribeye. When the chef had heard that his friend had a three hour layover in LaGuardia, he insisted on opening up his restaurant for him. They weren&#8217;t friends, per se. At least not by the normal definition of the word. The patron, a retired hit-man, had recently saved the chef&#8217;s and his family&#8217;s lives by intervening in a mob related &#8220;situation.&#8221; An intervention of the permanent sort.

&#8220;Can I get you some more wine, Marcello?&#8221;

&#8220;No thanks, Carlo. This is already too much. How much do I owe you?&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t insult me! For you, my restaurant is yours. Anything you want, any time, you just let me know and it&#8217;s yours!&#8221;

&#8220;You&#8217;re too generous, my friend. I&#8217;ll finish up here so you can get home to your family. The steak was marvellous by the way. Best I&#8217;ve ever tasted.&#8221;

Marcello was finishing up what would have been a three-hundred dollar meal, when his phone rang.

&#8220;Hello?&#8221;

&#8220;Marcello, *come va*?&#8221;

&#8220;Enrico, I told you a hundred times already, I&#8217;m out. I&#8217;m not taking any jobs.&#8221;

&#8220;I know, I know. It&#8217;s too bad though, you were the best.&#8221;

&#8220;It&#8217;s two in the morning, Enrico. What can I do for you?&#8221;

&#8220;Listen, Marcello, I have some information on Sansone&#8217;s whereabouts.&#8221;

Marcello couldn&#8217;t speak. The mere mention of Sansone Vespucci&#8217;s name gave him chills.

&#8220;Hello? Marcello, you there?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m here. That son of a b&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;I know, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m calling you. Look, he&#8217;s supposed to be in Vegas, the Bellagio. He&#8217;s there till the end of the week.&#8221;

&#8220;Thanks, Enrico. I appreciate it.&#8221; He made sure not to say, &#8220;I owe you one.&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. You get rid of Vespucci, you&#8217;ll be doing me a favor.&#8221;

Marcello hung up the phone. He needed to get back to the airport. He had to change his flight.
