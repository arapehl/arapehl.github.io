Back in December of &#8217;05 Molly wrote [Best. Spam. Ever.][1] at which time I was lucky enough not to have the problem of comment spam. Fast forward to about a month ago and suddenly my post [Proper URI design][2] started to gain the attention not of fellow web-heads, but of [spammer-freaks][3]. Who knows, it could have been my immensely popular post on [Coming soon to a theatre near you][4] (I confess, I [dugg][5] my own post) that opened me up to the non-web-head crowd. Either way, the comment spam began to flow.

About a week of moderating later it started to get annoying. That&#8217;s when I decided to give [Akismet][6] a try. O&#8217; the spam free bliss. Since I activated it, Akismet&#8217;s caught 112 of the annoying bits of comment excrement. I don&#8217;t even notice it until I log into WordPress and see the little number in the Akismet tab telling me that there&#8217;s junk waiting to be deleted.

Out of the 112 it&#8217;s caught so far, only 1 has slipped through the net. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a pretty good margin of error wouldn&#8217;t you? Captchas shmaptchas, I&#8217;m sold on Akismet and if you suffer from comment spam, I suggest you take a look at it too.
