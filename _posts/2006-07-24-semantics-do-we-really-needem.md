Perfect. <cite>The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</cite> defines the word *perfect* as <q>Lacking nothing essential to the whole; complete of its nature or kind</q>.

As a strong advocate for web standards and semantics, I&#8217;ve been actively pursuing perfection in this area for a while now and have recently begun to feel disillusioned. After covering all the bases (read: <b>ed and <br>eakfast), and performing all the fancy tricks, it seems I&#8217;ve run headlong into the outer edges of what HTML and CSS are capable of doing. Oh sure, I still try and make the technology do more than it&#8217;s deemed able. But it&#8217;s in this territory that the &#8220;rules&#8221; get vague. For example, how well do you think HTML is able to add meaning to your content? Don&#8217;t give me simple examples of using paragraphs and headings, or emphasis and strong tags. I mean really, what&#8217;s the better choice to mark up a breadcrumb navigation menu? A nested unordered list? A comma delimited paragraph with spans around each element for styling purposes? And what of the delimiter? What denotes &#8220;a child of&#8221;? Then there&#8217;s the infamous [heading debate][1]. Which interpretation of the [vague spec][2] is best?

So what to do when <q cite="http://www.csarven.ca/where-are-my-web-standards"><a href="http://www.csarven.ca/where-are-my-web-standards">&#8230;there exists a lot of room for interpretation&#8230;</a></q> in the spec? Does it even matter? The U.S. Census Bureau reports [1st Quarter 2006 Retail E-Commerce Sales are up almost 5% from 1st Q 2005][3]. In fact, they&#8217;ve been steadily climbing since 1999 without so much as a hickup during the dot com crash!

So what does that tell us? Will standards and semantics really help a company&#8217;s bottom line? Maybe. They&#8217;ll save money on bandwidth and maintenance costs. But take a look at [Google][4]&#8216;s markup and tell me if semantics is the secret to their success.

All I&#8217;m saying is that standards and semantics have their place, but sometimes in our zeal we [don&#8217;t see the forest for the trees][5]. Though standards and semantics make life a lot easier for the developer, and they make it a little easier on the pocketbook when it comes to maintaining a site, they aren&#8217;t what&#8217;s going to save the web and I think it&#8217;s about time that we stopped acting like they were.

In fact, I propose that we get our collective tail in gear and start developing apps that are specifically designed to take advantage of good, semantic markup. (I have a few ideas that&#8211;should I find the time&#8211;I&#8217;m considering developing.) Only then will standards and semantics really make a difference, when services won&#8217;t function without meaningful markup. Otherwise, you could throw a table, some font tags or a thousand line breaks into a pot, mix it all up and unless you view the source, it won&#8217;t matter one iota.

Tag soup anyone?
