<ins datetime="2006-03-30T21:09:00"><strong>Update:</strong> I wasn&#8217;t making this stuff up! Dennis Forbes in his post &#8220;<a href="http://www.yafla.com/dforbes/2006/03/29.html#a302">Interesting Facts About Domain Names</a>&#8221; illustrates my point perfectly with cold hard researched numbers!</ins>

Shopping for domain names has become such a pain in the rear. It&#8217;s no wonder that the majority of new (Web 2.0) sites out there have nonsensical names like &#8220;bootoo&#8221; and &#8220;yinko&#8221;.

It seems that any real world word or word combination has already been registered and &#8220;reserved&#8221; by some nameless, faceless company who has decided to post advertising on its temporary &#8220;under construction&#8221; page until it&#8217;s site is launched.

This is of course a scam. Those sites will never be launched, and will forever contain advertising. I know this for a few reasons. One of which was a job interview I went to where the &#8220;project manager&#8221; openly told me that he was responsible for *thousands* of domain names on which they posted their advertising for their &#8220;products&#8221;. Suffice it to say, as the conversation went on I felt a sickly feeling in my stomach and walked from that scam&#8211;err job opportunity.

I&#8217;ve also read/heard that domain registrars will go ahead and reserve choice domain names that are searched for through their lookup services. Is this true? Though I try to avoid conspiracy theories, I wonder if this rumour isn&#8217;t true.

All this to say that we need legislation that denies these people from reserving domain names for the sole purpose of running their scams. If a viable website isn&#8217;t launched within a set period of time, the domain name needs to be revoked.

Also, people, please! Don&#8217;t click the links that are on those pages. Every time you do, you urge these people on! That&#8217;s also the reason spam exists. Because about 2% of the people who get them ACTUALLY RESPOND!

&#8217;nuff said. Rant over.
