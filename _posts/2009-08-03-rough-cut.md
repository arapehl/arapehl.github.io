So I&#8217;ve started tracking again. It had been so long since I&#8217;d last written music that when I discovered a reimplementation of [Impulse Tracker][1] (called [Schism Tracker][2]) last week, I just couldn&#8217;t resist. So this past weekend, instead of vegetating in front of some random [game][3], I wrote. I raided the [sample packs page][4] from [The Freesound Project][5] and went to work. I must admit that I was quite a bit out of practice. I&#8217;d almost completely forgotten all the shortcut keys I&#8217;d grown so used to in the past. One of the major frustrations I had while writing was the sketchy *undo *command. It seems only some operations can be undone, so when you accidentally overwrite a note, or a whole channel, too bad. But I learned, and slowly started getting quick at tracking again.

So without further ado, here&#8217;s the first track that I&#8217;ve put togheter in about eight years. Please remember that this isn&#8217;t a final cut, nor is it anywhere near being complete, but I wanted to get it out there as soon as I could. (You may notice a 70&#8217;s Europop sound with a Russian sounding melody, it&#8217;s deliberate.)
