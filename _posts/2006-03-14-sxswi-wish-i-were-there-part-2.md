Man, this is starting to remind me of the good ol&#8217; days of the [demo scene][1]. All these people in the community meeting each other (at [SXSW][2]) and hanging out. Meanwhile I&#8217;m up here in Canada watching the snow melt. I just finished reading about [Matthew Oliphant][3]&#8216;s exciting (harrowing?) evening with friends [Garrett Dimon][4], [Dan Rubin][5], [Wade Winningham][6], and [Paul Scrivens][7] (get well soon Paul). Bar hopping, j-walking and nearly getting arrested aside (read his post) I would have loved the opportunity to meet the people whose blogs I read regularly and who share in my profession.

Also, a big congrats to [Brian Veloso (Avalonstar)][8] for winning the [web award for best blog][9].
