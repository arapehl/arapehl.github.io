**Note:** The colourful detail in this post is due to my knowing someone who recently went through this.

&#8212;

You&#8217;re smart, you&#8217;re passionate, you know your stuff, you&#8217;re a real code ninja. You&#8217;ve been building websites for years, you&#8217;ve got a couple of notable accomplishments under your belt and you figure, &#8220;hey, maybe *I* could play in the big leagues.&#8221; So you update your resume and you fire it off.

Before long you get an email response from a major player. OMG! Then a phone interview, OMG! then another phone interview (OMG!) and before you know it you&#8217;re on a plane to [insert country name here, let's say the States] for a bunch of face-to-face interviews, OMG! OMG! OMG!

The interviews go really well, you&#8217;re excited but you try not to get your hopes up too high. Not long after you get back home you get a call, they want to make you an offer! ZOMG! They even want to help you move to the States. There&#8217;s just one thing though, can you actually *work* in the States?

You figure, &#8220;yeah, maybe, sure I guess. I&#8217;ve got over a decade of experience and hey, I&#8217;ve got a *job offer*, that&#8217;s what you need to get this stuff worked out right, a job offer?&#8221; All you&#8217;ve got to do is give the company lawyer a call and see if they can hook you up. Y&#8217;know, work their magic, get you a visa, or figure something out. So you pick up the phone, excited but with a tinge of trepidation and the call goes something like this:

*Lawyer*: &#8220;Hello?&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;Hi, my name is Code Ninja, I interviewed with you guys and you love me. I need a visa&#8211;&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Who?&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;Code Ninja, C-o-d&#8211;&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Oh yeah, ummm, no, you don&#8217;t stand a chance.&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;What?&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Yeah, forget it buddy, you don&#8217;t stand a chance. You need a degree in order to get a visa and you don&#8217;t have one so forget it.&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;Surely you can do something, I mean&#8211;&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Nope.&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;But what about&#8211;&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;No.&#8221;  
*You*: &#8220;But&#8211;&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Look, if you had a degree I could have you down here in a week, but you don&#8217;t so&#8230;&#8221;  
[Awkward silence]  
*You*: &#8220;OK, well thanks and&#8230; thanks.&#8221;  
*Lawyer*: &#8220;Sure thing, better luck next time.&#8221; \*click\*

And that, my friends is why you should stay in school. Code ninja or not, the government of the country you&#8217;re trying to get into doesn&#8217;t care a lick. And the lawyer that&#8217;s supposed to be helping you won&#8217;t spend more energy on you than it takes to get you off the phone. So be smart, and **stay in school**!

And just in case you&#8217;ve got ideas about &#8220;finishing school later&#8221;&#8230;
