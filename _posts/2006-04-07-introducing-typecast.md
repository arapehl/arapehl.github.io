So I&#8217;ve started work on **[Typecast][1]**. I call it an **Input Field Augmentation Library**. The idea is to provide commonly used/desired functionality that isn&#8217;t available in the plain&#8217;ol HTML input field. Some examples include auto-completion, suggestion and realtime masking. I&#8217;ve been working on it for less than a week&#8211;in my free time&#8211;so it&#8217;s very much &#8220;in development&#8221; though the auto-complete/suggest functionality is pretty close to being done. There are of course a bunch of things I want to add (see the todo list on the Typecast page). Oh and for all you tech-heads out there, it&#8217;s completely unobtrusive and fully OO. I also try and optimize the code as much as possible to keep the performance level decent.

If you&#8217;re reading this, I&#8217;d like your feedback. Please, go mess around with it. Copy it, use it, try and break it. Let me know what you think and what you&#8217;d like to see.
