I&#8217;m extremely pleased to announce that the first issue of [Webstyle Magazine ][1]has gone live! The issue leads off with a [conversation with John Resig][2] about the work he&#8217;s doing in the mobile space. It has articles on [travel][3], [style][4], [beer][5] and [more][6] and rounds off with a [free wallpaper by Anton Peck][7]!

Be sure to [check it out][6] and [spread the word][8]!
