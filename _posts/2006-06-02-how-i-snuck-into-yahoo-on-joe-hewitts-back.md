[Joe Hewitt][1], the author of the incredibly useful Firefox extension [FireBug][2], was recently invited to Yahoo! to give a talk on his creation.

</p>

Like many others, I visited the YUI blog to view the [video][3] of said talk. About two or three minutes into watching it however I was surprised to see *my* name come up on the screen when Joe decided to demonstrate FireBug&#8217;s debugging capabilities by debugging comments on his blog. As a result of this, I got a bunch of screen time at Yahoo! Thanks for giving me my 15 seconds of fame Joe!

Now maybe they&#8217;ll get back to me ;-)
