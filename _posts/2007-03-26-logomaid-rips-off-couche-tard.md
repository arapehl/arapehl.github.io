It started out with the [theft of Dan&#8217;s logo][1]. Then I found out that [Nathan&#8217;s was ripped too][2]. So I thought I&#8217;d go looking for myself and sure enough, on the first page of &#8220;unique logos&#8221; I found a [ripoff of the Couche-Tard logo][3].

I guess nobody really picked up on that one because Couche-Tard is a local brand, but it jumped out at me when I saw it. I then posted it on Flickr, which seems to have spooked the LogoMaid folks because it&#8217;s been since [taken down][4]. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t manage to get a screen capture of the entire page but its uid is 4663, and even though it isn&#8217;t available, 4662 and 4664 are. Hence, it was taken down.

In my opinion, LogoMaid has lost face with the design community, big time&#8211;and if not quite yet, they will when word keeps spreading. I suggest that if they want to save face and rebuild trust with the community that they post a &#8220;report this logo&#8221; button on their pages. Or, they could just keep trying the futile game of defending the undefendable. I guess it&#8217;s up to them.
