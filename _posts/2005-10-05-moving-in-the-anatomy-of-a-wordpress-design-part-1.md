### Situation

I&#8217;ve just moved over to a new blogging package and I desperately need to work on a unique design. 

### Problem

I can&#8217;t take my time doing it because it looks bad, but I don&#8217;t have all that much free time to do it in.

### Solution

Live redesign!

That&#8217;s right. Rather than leave this wonderful out-of-the-box template as is for weeks on end while I toil away behind the scenes on a new design, I&#8217;ll be taking you along for the ride. One painfully excruciating step at a time. You&#8217;ll be privy to all of my mis-steps and colossal design *faux pas* while I figure out just what I can do in WordPress. And I&#8217;ll be counting on you to help me along with your comments, so spread the word. The more feedback, the better the site. Right?

A lot of what I&#8217;ve done to date has been centered on function rather than form. After all, a functional blog, with great content will draw tons and tons and tons of readers. Right? \*Sigh\*

So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done so far: I&#8217;ve routed my feeds through [Feedburner][1], I&#8217;ve claimed the blog on [Technorati][2], I&#8217;ve added [Talkr][3] podcasting to the posts (see post footers), I&#8217;ve [gotten rid of the &#8220;www&#8221;][4] prefix from my address (thanks for the heads up [Mathias][5]), I&#8217;ve installed a few WordPress plugins that&#8217;ll make my life easier such as: [IImage Browser][6], the Huddled Masses [Acronym Replacer][7] and the [Coldforged Spelling Checker][8] and I&#8217;ve imported a few of my posts from *passable* and *the simple web*.

So as you can see, I&#8217;ve been busy. What I&#8217;d like to do next is work on a logo and a color scheme. Then a layout. I&#8217;m thinking of a wide three column design. And of course, all the while focusing on content, content, content!
