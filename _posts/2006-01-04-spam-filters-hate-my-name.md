What usually happens is a spam filter catches my comment and tells me that it needs to be moderated and/or that I&#8217;m blacklisted. 

I was rather perturbed the first time I saw that I was *blacklisted* from a site I had never posted on! When it happened again, I got suspicious. After much agonizing and some searching the web I found the reason why. You see, when filling out comments you&#8217;re asked for your URL and mine is my name, just put together. Now, when you put my name together you get &#8220;arapehlivanian&#8221; which isn&#8217;t such a big deal right? Well, look closely, right there, near the beginning, do you see it? Here, let me help you, &#8220;a**rape**hlivanian.&#8221; Now do you see it? Well, suffice it to say I&#8217;m not at all happy with this because at least one or two times out of ten my comments get blocked.

Sometimes, if I care enough about the comment that I want to post, I end up writing the owner of the blog so that I can embarrassingly plead my case and get the word &#8220;rape&#8221; off of their spam list.

\*sigh\* why me?
