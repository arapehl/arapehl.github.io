[Last November][1], I gave myself the challenge of writing a short story a day for a year. It was an ambitious goal. If you&#8217;ve been keeping up with the project though, you&#8217;ll have noticed that my writing has since slowed down and nearly come to a halt. I don&#8217;t want to drop the project because I love to write, but I will be shifting gears to a more easy, infrequent pace.

The lesson here, I think, is summed up quite nicely by Homer Simpson&#8217;s immortal words:

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.25em;">
  <p>
    You tried your best and failed miserably. The lesson is: never try.
