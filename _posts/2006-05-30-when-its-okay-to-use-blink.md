The [CBC&#8217;s Doctor Who page][1] has a blinking cursor (of sorts) that preceeds the text &#8220;Transmission interrupted. Re-initializing&#8230;&#8221; In this example, for the first time ever, I think I&#8217;ve found a decent use of &#8220;blink&#8221;.

Blink state: on

Blink state: off
:   <img id="image193" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/off.gif" alt="Blink state: off" />
