[Stoyan Stefanov][1] decided to release a post a day during the advent season in an effort to bolster our budding performance community.

He was kind enough to let me participate, not once but twice! My first contribution was called, [JavaScript Loading Strategies][2] and my second, which is out today is called, [Extreme Performance Optimization][3].

I hope you enjoy reading them, and be sure to check out the other posts in Stoyan&#8217;s [performance advent calendar][4] as well!
