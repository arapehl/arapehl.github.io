I&#8217;ve been itching to play with [Canvas][1] for a while now and tonight I finally had the time and energy to actually do [something with it][2]*.

Granted it&#8217;s very basic in terms of what Canvas can do, but I&#8217;ve been in love with starfields ever since I coded my first one years ago in Quick Basic and I&#8217;ve been dying to do one in JavaScript for a long time now. Canvas gave me the opportunity to generate and move real pixels around&#8211;instead of DOM elements!

For those of you who want to pick the code apart, note the easy instantiation of the `Starfield` class. With literally 3 lines of code you can add another starfield to the page. :-)

<small>* In case you didn&#8217;t catch it in the post title, this only works in Safari and recent Gecko based browsers like Firefox and Opera.</small>
