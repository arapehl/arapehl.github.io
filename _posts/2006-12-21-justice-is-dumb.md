  <img id="image258" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/blind_justice.jpg" alt="Statue of Lady Justice" />I always thought that the most asinine legal battles were fought in <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/2005/12/14/us-legal-system-joke/">patent court</a>. I was wrong. I came across this gem while browsing the pages of MSNBC&#8217;s site: &#8220;<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16317443/">A wound may be key to attempted murder case</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s about a guy who admitted involvement in a robbery, who has a bullet lodged in his forehead&#8211;&#8220;allegedly&#8221; as a result of being shot by his victim when trying to kill him&#8211;but is fighting to have it removed on the grounds that his civil liberties would be violated. A judge has already granted a search warrant so that the bullet can be taken out (and presumably tested to prove that he was in fact the one trying to kill the robbery victim). But he&#8217;s fighting it. Everyone involved&#8211;namely the doctors&#8211;agrees that the procedure isn&#8217;t life threatening.

I&#8217;m all for the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. But I draw the line at preventing the collection of evidence. Especially if the evidence you&#8217;re obstructing could potentially exonorate you&#8211;unless of course you&#8217;re hiding something. I can&#8217;t believe this sort of chicanery is tolerated in the American legal system.
