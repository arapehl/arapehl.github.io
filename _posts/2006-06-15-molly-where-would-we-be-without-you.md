  <img id="image216" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/molly.jpg" alt="Molly E. Holzschlag" />The odds are that you&#8217;ve probably heard of Molly Holzschlag, but in the off chance that you haven&#8217;t, she&#8217;s a very big friend of the Web Standards movement and one of its greatest proponents who&#8217;s done much to help in its advancement. I&#8217;m writing this post because she isn&#8217;t doing very well right now as is evident in her post: <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/06/15/counting-coup-telling-the-true/">Counting Coup, Telling True</a>. So please take a minute to drop her a word of encouragement. I think we all owe her at least that much.

**Update**: I&#8217;m happy to report that things seem to be [going better][1].
