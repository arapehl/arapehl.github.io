Congratulations Barack Obama for winning the Presidency of the United States of America. May you be granted the strength and wisdom to make good on the promise of hope you campaigned on and may God bless your years in the White House.

Once again, congratulations to you, Joe Biden, your families and all of the talented people who worked with you to make this historic achievement happen!
