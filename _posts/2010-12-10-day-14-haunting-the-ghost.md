*[Continued from Day 14. When the Ghost Chases You][1]*

Being a social engineer means thinking incredibly fast on your feet. The people you&#8217;re conning can be highly unpredictable so you need to be ready for anything. You need to know exactly what to say and deliver it convincingly with a rock solid poker face. Falling out of character for even for an instant could spell disaster. Especially when you&#8217;re surrounded by a squad of grunts and your mark is your own father.

Like a chess Grandmaster, Patrick&#8217;s mind began working through different strategies and calculations. He needed to stay several steps ahead if he was to come out of this on top. *Alright, what could they know? What do they have on me?* He&#8217;d been meticulous in his planning, he&#8217;d covered his tracks, set false leads in his wake. No matter, he knew what he needed to do now. The game was on. &#8220;Dad!&#8221; He got up to give his father a hug. The man closest to his father moved to block him.

&#8220;No, it&#8217;s alright. He&#8217;s my son,&#8221; his father said and the man backed off.

*Protective detail. Interesting. *

They hugged. &#8220;It&#8217;s so good to see you son,&#8221; he said in Patrick&#8217;s ear.

&#8220;What happened dad?&#8221; he asked, still holding on to his father. *Shoulder holster.*

Releasing his grip, his father rested his hands on his son&#8217;s shoulders. He stared at him in silence for a prolonged period. He smiled with his mouth, but not his eyes. So much had happened, so much had changed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t talk about it,&#8221; he said, sitting back down.

Patrick took his seat. &#8220;So, dad. What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; he was playing completely innocent.

&#8220;You see that rather irate looking fellow out there?&#8221; he said tilting his head toward the glass front door.

There was a man in uniform standing outside by a Humvee. His rank insignia made him a general. *So, it&#8217;s to be friend and foe*. He could handle &#8220;good cop/bad cop.&#8221;

&#8220;He isn&#8217;t very happy about what you did and he wants you to return what you stole.&#8221;

&#8220;Stole? I didn&#8217;t steal anything! I was looking for you!&#8221;

&#8220;Son, who do you think you&#8217;re dealing with? This isn&#8217;t some third-rate outfit you conned. Listen, right now I&#8217;m the only thing standing between you and the hotter-than-hell fury of the Pentagon. And that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m your father and made a request for leniency.&#8221;

&#8220;So, what do they want from me?&#8221;

&#8220;All the files. Every copy.&#8221;

&#8220;Then I go free?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes.&#8221;

Patrick reached into his pocked and pulled out a thumb drive. He hesitantly handed it to his father.

&#8220;This is everything? What about copies?&#8221;

&#8220;Too sensitive, couldn&#8217;t risk keeping more than one copy. I&#8217;m not an idiot. I don&#8217;t want to bring down a country because I&#8217;m looking for my dad.&#8221;

The senior Harris paused for a moment, thinking that over. &#8220;Alright,&#8221; he said, motioning to the men in the room. Two of them walked over to Patrick and began to cuff him.

&#8220;But you said I could go!&#8221;

&#8220;Yes I did. And just as soon as we can verify that this is the only copy, you will.&#8221;

One of the men put a black bag over Patrick&#8217;s head. &#8220;I&#8217;d rethink my strategy if I were you,&#8221; he said from under the bag.

His father paused and turned toward his son, &#8220;oh?&#8221;

&#8220;Ever heard of a dead man&#8217;s switch?&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m locked up, I won&#8217;t be able to stop my contingency plan from ruining your day.&#8221;

His father was very attentive now. &#8220;What contingency plan?&#8221;

&#8220;What would your irate general friend out there do if his precious documents got into the public domain? Because that&#8217;s exactly what will happen if you cart me off.&#8221;

There was silence for a moment.

&#8220;Keep him here,&#8221; he heard his father say as he walked to the door.

*He&#8217;s got to check with his boss.*

A few moments later the café door chimed as his father walked back in. He signaled the men to take the bag off Patrick&#8217;s head. &#8220;Uncuff him,&#8221; he said with reluctance in his voice.

Patrick smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m free to go?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes. But this isn&#8217;t over. We need assurances that those documents will be destroyed.&#8221;

&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk,&#8221; he said, walking out the café, past the general and into the night. He needed to get to a safe location and get online. They&#8217;d be plugging that thumb drive in soon, and he was looking forward to the access it would give him to their systems.
