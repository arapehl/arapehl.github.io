</p>

1.  Research and then write meaningful, useful, well thought out articles/posts based on hard data and references
2.  Redo my home page
3.  Improve my site&#8217;s semantics
4.  Improve my site&#8217;s CSS
5.  Simplify my site&#8217;s design
6.  Write a book on Web Standards
7.  Write a novel in the techno-thriller genre (some of my [writing][1])
8.  Code a few web apps kicking around in my head
9.  Develop a few microformats kicking around in my head
10. Write a bunch of JavaScripts kicking around in my head
11. Invent the next big thing on the web ;-)

What would you do? Or do you *have* the time, in which case what *are* you doing?
