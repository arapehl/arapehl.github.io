title: If You Want It Done Right, Use A Third Party
author: Ara Pehlivanian
excerpt: |
  You know that saying, "if you want it done right, you've got to do it yourself?" When it comes to software development, I say, "<strong>not if it isn't your core product</strong>." In other words, don't write an entire JavaScript library or CMS by yourself if your focus is building websites for clients.

You know that saying, &#8220;if you want it done right, you&#8217;ve got to do it yourself?&#8221; When it comes to software development, I say, &#8220;**not if it isn&#8217;t your core product**.&#8221; In other words, don&#8217;t write an entire JavaScript library or CMS by yourself if your focus is building websites for clients.

Third parties like the [YUI][1] and [jQuery][2] teams for example have huge user bases who field test and report bugs far more rigorously than any in-house QA regimen can ever hope to. And since the YUI and jQuery libraries are their respective teams&#8217; core products, they do nothing but build, debug and maintain them full time, which is far more than any in-house team could hope to do. And if a dedicated in-house team is put together to focus strictly on a non-core product, then it will at a direct cost to the company. And what do you do when you need another library to answer another need? Build another team? That&#8217;s hardly a cost-effective solution.

Bottom line, whether it&#8217;s a JavaScript library, a CMS, a utility or a service. Whatever your need, if a third party does it and offers it either for free or at a nominal fee, you&#8217;re much better off going with them than doing it yourself.
