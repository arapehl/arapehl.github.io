So, when I first moved from Blogger to my own domain, I said that I&#8217;d be doing a live redesign and that everyone would be able to see all of my mistakes as I went along. Well, it&#8217;s an eyesore, I know and you&#8217;re witnessing it. Actually, this is what happened. I was stuck in the default WordPress template and I wanted out. I wanted full control over the look and feel and I did managed to lay everything out well enough, but then I got caught up in NaNoWriMo and everything stopped. I added a few touches here and there (like color) but because it was rushed I ended up with the atrocity you see in front of you.

Well, NaNoWriMo&#8217;s taken too much of my time, and I&#8217;ve fallen too far behind to catch up now so I&#8217;m going to concentrate on putting together a half decent design instead of killing myself trying to write 1600+ words a day. It will take time because I don&#8217;t want to rush, and in order to avoid the panic that usually comes from a &#8220;live&#8221; redesign&#8212;oh that sucks, okay quick fix, oh crap that&#8217;s worse! okay, another fix, ahhh!&#8212;I&#8217;ve set up a development server to work on until I&#8217;m happy with it.
