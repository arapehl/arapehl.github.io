Here&#8217;s a sampling of a few retired passwords I used at one time or other. The thing about witty passwords is that you obviously can&#8217;t share them with anyone while you&#8217;re using them. So you chuckle to yourself every time you type them in. Anyhow, I think these speak for themselves as far as my disdain for passwords goes.
