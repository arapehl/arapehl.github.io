    <strong>Update:</strong> Looks like everything is back to normal. Doesn&#8217;t seem like the stats were lost after all. They just weren&#8217;t coming up.

    It seems like something&#8217;s happened with yesterday&#8217;s FeedBurner statistics because it&#8217;s reporting 0 readers. My first reaction was &#8220;that can&#8217;t be,&#8221; but then I thought, &#8220;could it?&#8221; So I checked 37signals&#8217; blog: <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a> because I know that they have subscribers in the thousands and sure enough their reader count is also at 0. I guess there was a little trouble at FeedBurner yesterday. Oh well.
