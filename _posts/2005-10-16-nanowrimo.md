Write 50,000 words in 30 days. Insane? Yeah. But I signed up for it anyway. The month of November is [National Novel Writing Month][1] (NaNoWriMo). It&#8217;s a challenge where participants try to write a 50,000 word novel in one month. It&#8217;s actually the perfect thing that I&#8217;ve needed to get my writing going. I&#8217;ve been saying for years now that I want to write a novel, so here&#8217;s my opportunity. What&#8217;s cool is that sub-par quality is a given due to the immense rush in which it will be written. So it makes the challenge all the more interesting, and realistic. Now, to just get a complex plot formulated in time for November 1st. Wish me luck! ;-)
