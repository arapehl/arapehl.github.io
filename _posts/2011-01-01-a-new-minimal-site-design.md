<p class="tldr">
  I&#8217;ve always been a fan of minimalism; it appeals to me. But by nature, I&#8217;m not a minimalist. I tend to hold on to things which inevitably creates clutter. Eventually though, I get tired of the buildup and I purge the clutter and I&#8217;m left feeling lighter and more free.

<p class="tldr">
  For a very long time, I&#8217;d been thinking about applying the principle of minimalism to my site. I wanted to eliminate all the stuff that distracted from the content, keeping it simple, focused. Turns out, it&#8217;s harder to do than I&#8217;d thought. I found myself questioning the need for everything. Some things I could eliminate outright; others, I had to hide. One trick I picked up was from <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC.com</a>. Post-launch, they load an additional block of content at the top of the page and scroll the page in order to keep it hidden off screen. I used that technique to hide my site navigation. Also, I didn&#8217;t want that nav to be the first content in the DOM. I wanted the post, article or whatever else the page was about to be first. So I put the navigation at the end of the page, moving it up top with CSS. Finally, I got rid of the &#8220;list of posts&#8221; home page and replaced it with a simpler, more focused page. Oh, and I did away with images. All the gradients and buttons you see are pure CSS. I didn&#8217;t want to pull down extra files unnecessarily.

  I&#8217;m happy with the end product, but I consider it a work in progress. I think there&#8217;s a lot more room for refinement and adjustment. If you have any constructive criticism, please, feel free to <a href="mailto:ara.pehlivanian@gmail.com">write me</a>.
