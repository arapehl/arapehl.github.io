<img style="border: medium none ; float: right" id="image143" alt="The IT Crowd" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/TheITCrowd.gif" />[The IT Crowd][1] is an awesome new sitcom out of the UK featuring a couple of underappreciated IT geeks and their female boss&#8211;who knows nothing of computers yet somehow got assigned the task of managing the department&#8211;working for a huge company run by a half-cocked loose canon of a CEO. I watched the first episode (thanks Schmu!) and was hooked! I&#8217;d describe it as [The Office][2] meets [Red Dwarf][3] meets [Seinfeld][4]. Really funny stuff, even if you&#8217;re not an IT geek.

[Watch IT][5] and [watch IT some more][6]. Every episode is better than the last!
