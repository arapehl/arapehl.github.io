My dearest Abigail,

Three terrible years have past since we parted on that cold December morning. Those last moments we stole before I boarded the transport are forever etched in my mind. The memory of your radiant smile, despite your fear and heartache, is one of my most cherished possessions. Your strength and bravery in that moment have continually inspired the like in me these past three years, my love.

So much has happened in that time. Sadly, we suffered great losses at the hand of our enemy. The battle of Orion was particularly grave. It&#8217;s where we lost Barclay, among other brave men. I wish it were that I was still a private, since my advancement in rank came at the cost of so much bloodshed and pain. And yet, the thought of returning to you has been foremost on my mind and has carried me through some of the darker moments in this infernal war.

That I&#8217;m able to write you means that my tour is finally over. We arrived at moon-base Alpha three hours ago and I made haste to write you the moment I could. I&#8217;m told that the next earth-bound transport is due here in three days. Until then I&#8217;ll be sitting on the moon, missing you.

All my love,  
Harry
