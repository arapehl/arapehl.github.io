About two weeks ago I wrote a post on [<q>How to benefit from major web conferences for free</q>][1]. Today I was pleasantly surprised to find out that only a day after wrap-up, SXSW 2007&#8217;s Interactive Panels are already being released on the SXSW [podcast blog][2]!

I&#8217;ve already listened to, and recommend, &#8220;After the Brief: A Field Guide to Design Inspiration.&#8221; It&#8217;s really very insightful. I&#8217;ve got the rest of them queued up on my iPod. Now all I need is some bumper-to-bumper traffic&#8230;
