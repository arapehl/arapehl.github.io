[Dean Kamen][1], inventor of the famed [Segway][2] and the lesser known but so much more incredible [iBOT Mobility System][3] has outdone himself again with his latest invention, the Luke Arm. Yes, it&#8217;s a prosthetic arm eons ahead of anything out there and yes, it&#8217;s named after Luke Skywalker&#8217;s prosthetic arm.

Kamen [discussed][4] his latest invention, comissioned by DARPA to aid amputee soldiers, at the D6 Conference today. I&#8217;ve embedded the [video of his discussion][5] below.
