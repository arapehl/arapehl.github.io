Just recently Andy Budd was [talking about][1] how there weren&#8217;t really any satisfactory publications aimed specifically at web professionals. Enter [Treehouse][2] from [Particletree][3]. I can easily sum this monthly PDF magazine up in two words: Wow. Nice!

Treehouse is a publication for web professionals by web professionals. They speak the language and they&#8217;re in the know. In fact, you&#8217;ve probably got most of the authors&#8217; blogs in your aggregator.

This very clean looking magazine is a joy to read, with layout, typography and color use that&#8217;s both easy on your eyes and attractive in its simplicity. You won&#8217;t find gawdy design meant to make up for a lack of content here. In fact, what makes Treehouse really great is the *quality* of its content. The first issue contains articles from, and interview with a veritable who&#8217;s who of web development and design. We&#8217;re talking [Shaun Inman][4], [Jason Santa Maria][5], and [Jeremy Keith][6], to name a few. And in a clever marketing move, the folks at Particletree have opted to offer the first issue for [free][7]. 

I&#8217;ve only had it for less than a day and I&#8217;ve read most of the 58 pages already. If the subsequent issues are as good as the first, then the $15 for a 6 month subscription is well worth the price.
