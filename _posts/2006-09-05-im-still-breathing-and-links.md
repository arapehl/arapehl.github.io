Wow it&#8217;s been a long time since I last posted anything. I&#8217;m still breathing, just been a little busy lately. I hope to be posting regularly soon. I&#8217;m also wondering if this site couldn&#8217;t use an overhaul. Who knows, we&#8217;ll see. In the meanwhile,

### Things that rock:

[Steve Irwin][1]
:   Rest in peace mate.

[WAMP Server][2]
:   Install PHP 5, Apache 2 and MySQL 5 on your WinXP (Home!) box

[Akismet][3]
:   Stop comment spam and trackback spam.

[YUI][4]
:   Some of the best conceived front-end code I&#8217;ve come across in a long time.

[FireBug][5]
:   Indespensable tool for any serious front-end developer/designer

[Untitled][6]
:   Sweet original music for Noah Kalina&#8217;s &#8220;[everyday][7]&#8220;.

[Dream Projections JavaScript syntax highlighter][8]
:   Best syntax highlighter I&#8217;ve seen thus far.

[JSDoc][9]
:   Document your code! Use JSDoc to do it.

[Mac vs. PC][10] (Gaming)
:   Switch!

Eternal life

### Things that suck:

The clicking in my throat
:   Who knows what the heck it is, dislocated trachea? All I know is, it clicks and it&#8217;s a royal pain in the neck. (sigh, I couldn&#8217;t help it.) Doctor says it&#8217;s bone rubbing on bone. That doesn&#8217;t seem too normal to me. \*shrug\*

YouTube tech support.
:   I don&#8217;t know what the heck&#8217;s going on over there. I asked them a simple question and in return I received the same copy/paste response of their FAQ page without a shred of personalization or even a signature. I received the same **exact** response regardless of what I said or asked. Either they don&#8217;t have any tech support and there&#8217;s just a batch script that tries to send you relevant information on your question, or there are some pretty incompetent tech support folks at YouTube.
