Am I the only one to have noticed that Matt Smith is [listed][1] as the eleventh person with the name &#8220;Matt Smith&#8221; in IMDB, and that he just so happens to be [playing][2] the eleventh Doctor?

How&#8217;s that for odd?

And yes, I did submit this nugget for addition to [his IMDB bio page][3] under &#8220;trivia.&#8221; I&#8217;m a geek like that.

**Update:** My submission to IMDB has been accepted and is now online. w00t!
