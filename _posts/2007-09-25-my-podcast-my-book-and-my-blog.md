<span class="lead">It&#8217;s been a bit quiet around here lately.</span> 

For a while my time was taken up by a four hour daily production&#8211;aka the [Web Dev Digest][1] podcast&#8211;until work and family obligations made it impossible to continue. After that, instead of taking a break, I wrote a book. Well, actually just a chapter in a book, [The Art &#038; Science of JavaScript][2], which is due out in January of 2008. <!--more-->All the while, my blog languished. Well, now that I&#8217;m starting to find a few spare minutes in the day, I&#8217;ve
resolved to focus on my blog. I&#8217;m planning a complete revamp of the site. I might post in the interim, though more than likely I&#8217;ll be focusing on the revamp and saving the content for when I relaunch. In the meanwhile, you can follow me on Twitter: <http://twitter.com/ara_p>.
