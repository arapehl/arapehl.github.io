I finally bit the bullet and decided to go ahead with my dream of publishing an online magazine. [Webstyle Magazine][1], *the* lifestyle mag for the web professionals will launch on July 1st.

The mag will go beyond the standard fare of how-to tech articles and cover any and everything that is of interest to people in the field. This includes conferences, travel, gear, food & drink, entertainment, health, etc. After all, web professionals are people too, and we have interests that go beyond the latest JavaScript optimization technique. So now, there&#8217;s a publication that will cover those interests.

We&#8217;re actively looking for contributors as we line up content for future issues. If you&#8217;re at all interested in contributing, by all means, let us know by writing to:  
m a i l b a g   [ a t ]   w e b s t y l e m a g   [ d o t ]   c o m.

And like any publication, we&#8217;re keen on gaining readership, so come on by, follow us on twitter ([@webstylemag][2]) and spread the word!
