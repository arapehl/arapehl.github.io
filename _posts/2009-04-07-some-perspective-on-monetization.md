As an amateur blogger I&#8217;ve always found this drive to monetize every tittle on the web as a curiosity bordering on the annoying. If anything it&#8217;s felt like the invasion of the MBAs eager to put their degrees to work. You know, guys who know everything about business and nothing about the web looking to turn a buck.

And therein lies the problem. The product they&#8217;re pushing *isn&#8217;t a product at all*, it&#8217;s a *pass time*. It&#8217;s like trying to monetize kite flying. To make things worse, the only viable monetization business model to come out of the web&#8211;apart from actually selling something tangible à la Amazon.com&#8211;is advertising. But it isn&#8217;t working. Why? Because advertisers [aren&#8217;t interested][1] in paying to be displayed next to [an old man smoking a pipe][2].

Monetizing UGC is the wrong approach to business on the web. The quality just isn&#8217;t there, and advertisers want quality, yet 99.999% of the web&#8217;s UGC is anything but. So maybe the right strategy is to find a different way to make a buck off the web. Maybe that&#8217;ll be the next big thing.
