Dustin Diaz is launching the [first annual CSS Naked Day][1] on April 5th 2006. Those brave enough to participate will run their sites completely CSS free for the entire day. The point is to show off the &#8220;semantic-ness&#8221; of your markup. Way to go Dustin! I&#8217;m in! Any takers?

(Hat tip to [Sarven][2] for the heads up)
