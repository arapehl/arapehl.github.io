Why? I haven&#8217;t a clue. But someone decided it would be fun to hack my site. I was able to get out of the mess as best as you see it for now. I&#8217;ll fix up the template just as soon as I get two minutes.

Thanks for understanding.

Oh, and as much as I&#8217;d like it to be, this **isn&#8217;t** an April fools joke. It&#8217;s just a really bad coincidence that it happened today.

<ins><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve managed to get everything up and running again. Let me know if you notice anything broken.</ins>  
<ins><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like I was hacked to pawn cheap pharmaceuticals. Nice. <img src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hack.gif" alt="hack" title="hack" width="679" height="228" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-511" /></ins>
