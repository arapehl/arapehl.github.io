Well, as you may have noticed the site&#8217;s header is different and it isn&#8217;t anything like what I was planning. It isn&#8217;t permanent (notice the &#8220;BETA&#8221;?)

I guess I just got tired of the ugly blue background with the giant bold text over it and decided to whip something together really quickly to give the site some semblance of individuality. The lemons are synonymous with the word *passable* which I chose for my first serious blogging endeavour and represent the view of mediocrity I have of my design abilities.

I am so jealous of all those [talented illustrators][1] and [designers][2] out there who make [awesome][3] design seem so [effortless][4].

There. I said it. Shame on me. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

I did have to make a few minor adjustments in the default CSS however. I had to move both the title and description out of the way as they were being superimposed over the header image (it&#8217;s a [background image][5]). I used [Mike Rundle][6]&#8216;s technique.

Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, I&#8217;m off to go watch [Underworld][7]. I hope it wasn&#8217;t a wasted rental.
