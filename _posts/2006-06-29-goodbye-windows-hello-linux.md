Yep that&#8217;s right, Windows &#8217;98, an eight year old operating system as of this writing. It was slow, it was buggy, it was unstable and man was it just a painful experience to work with. So why was I using it, and why did I ditch it now after eight years of enduring the pain?
</p>

I was using it because I bought Windows 3.1 when it was the state-of-the-art, then I upgraded it to Windows &#8217;95 and then to &#8217;98. You can probably tell that I don&#8217;t believe in software piracy. Anyway, so after I baught &#8217;98, I just couldn&#8217;t afford to upgrade anymore. I mean, Windows is really expensive, especially at full price&#8211;they wouldn&#8217;t let me upgrade form &#8217;98 to XP. So, I trudged along with &#8217;98 for a few years until a very kind member of the family gave us the gift of a digital camera. Of course, the software it came with wouldn&#8217;t work with my OS (it went back to Windows &#8217;98 SE, which stands for &#8216;Second Edition&#8217;, I have the first edition!).

I desperately wanted to dump the photos on the camera onto my computer, but wasn&#8217;t about to shell out hundreds of dollars on an OS upgrade. Especially because it wouldn&#8217;t end there, my PC is a Pentium II 300Mhz, hardly a powerful machine by today&#8217;s standards. So I looked into Linux. [A friend and coworker][1] of mine recently installed [Ubuntu][2] (a Linux distribution) on his workstation at work and told me how great it was. So that&#8217;s where I started. I went and downloaded the CD image from their site and after two failed attempts to burn the thing I finally got it right (thanks to a guy on [#ubuntu][3]!).

## A breath of fresh air

I&#8217;ve got to tell you, Linux just rocks. It&#8217;s faster, more stable and I dare say &#8220;smarter&#8221; than Windows and I&#8217;ve only been using it for a day and a half! It&#8217;s as advanced as Windows XP (and from what I hear even Vista) and it works just fine on my &#8220;old&#8221; machine. Granted, I&#8217;ve got about 512MB of RAM, but hey it&#8217;s still a PII 300. I mean, I plugged my camera in and bam! no drivers or anything, it just showed me my pictures and asked me if I wanted to download them. And get this, **you don&#8217;t have to reboot every time you install something!** The one CD install of Ubuntu came not only with the OS (duh!), but with [Open Office][4], and [GIMP][5] (an open source Photoshop equivalent). Two apps whose Windows counterparts would have knocked my wallet back into the stone age. Not to mention all of the open source software that&#8217;s available to download. And get this, I was able to run the OS from the CD before installing it in order to try it out! And if you can&#8217;t download and burn the CD yourself, they&#8217;ll [ship it to you for free][6]!

So as you can tell, I&#8217;m a little extatic about this whole transition. Yeah, there&#8217;s a bit of a learning curve, but it&#8217;s well worth it now that my PC&#8217;s had new life breathed into it.
