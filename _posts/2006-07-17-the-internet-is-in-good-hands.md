I&#8217;ve been a little busy lately (haven&#8217;t read a blog in a week and I&#8217;m up to 1700+ unread ;-) but I just had to post this. I always had a hard time with the idea that people who knew nothing at all about a particular subject (medicine, agriculture, or the Internet) would be put in charge of regulating it. Ahhh, you&#8217;ve gotta love politics.

    Don&#8217;t see anything? You&#8217;re using IE right? Then try viewing it at YouTube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DClkE64nFDY">Jon Stewart on Net Neutrality</a>.
