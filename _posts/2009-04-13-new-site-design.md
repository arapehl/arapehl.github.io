If you read this blog in a feed reader, then you won&#8217;t notice the change, but I&#8217;ve completely redesigned my site. There were two motivating factors behind the redesign. One, I was tired of the green look, and two, I really wanted to simplify the markup.

The result is what you see. Suffice it to say, it&#8217;s a departure from the previous look. What do you think?
