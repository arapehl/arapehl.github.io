  <img id="image282" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/stikkit1.gif" alt="stikkit logo" />I came across <a href="http://www.stikkit.com/">stikkit</a> today and quickly spiraled into an angry depression within seconds of looking at the site. Why? Because about eight months ago, I had an identical idea&#8211;to the T. I was so convinced of its usefulness as a tool, and knowing my tendency to procrastinate, that I even registered a domain name to motivate myself to build it (<a href="http://www.notefilter.com/">notefilter.com</a>). I pondered building it, I thought of how I could go about it, and I even made a few attempts to write some code. But alas, I never really gave it the effort it deserved.

Eight months after I registered notefilter.com, it was built, by someone else, with a different name, stikkit. Now I think I know a little of how [Elisha Gray][1] felt on March 7, 1876, except that he actually worked on his idea and was a couple of hours late getting to the patent office. I just did more dreaming than doing.

> Ara&#8217;s life lesson #1: &#8220;Act on your ideas right away, before someone else does.&#8221;

Anyway, any good counsellor would tell me about now that the most constructive thing I could do is learn something positive from this situation. And that of course would be to act on my ideas right away. The sad part is, this isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened to me. Thankfully I can&#8217;t remember off the top of my head what the other idea I had was&#8211;probably my mind repressing bad memories.
