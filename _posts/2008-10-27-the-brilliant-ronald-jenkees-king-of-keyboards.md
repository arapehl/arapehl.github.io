I stumbled across a video of [Ronald Jenkees][1] today and my jaw dropped. This guy has so much talent on keyboards it&#8217;s mind blowing, I&#8217;ve included a few clips of him improvising on YouTube below, check&#8217;em out then head on over to [his site][2] and [buy his CD][3]. You might also want to subscribe to [his YouTube channel][4].
