Ever wonder what an *em* dash was for? Ever heard of an *en* dash? Did you know that they were quite different from the simple hyphen? Well, if you want to learn more, read this article entitled [En Dashes and Em Dashes][1] by [Get It Write Online][2].

<ins datetime="2005-10-21T19:31:36-05:00">Update: According to: &#8220;<a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/emen">The Trouble With EM ’n EN (and Other Shady Characters)</a>&#8221; (thanks <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/2005/10/19/em-dash-explained/#comment-28">Mathias</a>) the correct numeric entities for em and en dashes are not &#0151; and &#0150; as stated in the above mentioned article, but &#8212; and &#8211; respectively.</ins>  
<ins datetime="2005-10-21T19:31:36-05:00">I&#8217;ve also added this post to the <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/category/web-development/semantics/">Semantics</a> category since using the correct character for the job (rather than using the hyphen key on your keyboard) is the semantically correct way of doing things. I&#8217;ve also filed it under a new category named <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/category/web-development/typography/">Typography</a>.</ins>
