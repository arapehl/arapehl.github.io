In an age of progress where so many web developers are embracing standards (see: Eric Meyer&#8217;s [Redesign Watch][1], the [Web Standards Awards][2], and [CSS Beauty][3]) it&#8217;s a very sad day indeed when a company as large as Disney allows its [DisneyStore.co.uk][4] property to regress to the bad old days of the web.

Our friend [Malarkey][5] had done such a wonderful job of building a [standards based site for the Disney Store UK][6] which he now reports in: &#8220;[Of mice and men][7]&#8221; has gone the way of the dodo. Not to go down without a fight, [WaSP][8]&#8216;s Group Lead [Molly][9] lambastes Disney in: &#8220;[An Open Letter to Disney Store UK][10]&#8221; for their colossal misstep. The reason she gives for writing an open letter is indicative of the rot that is non-standards design: <q cite="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/03/an-open-letter-to-disney-store-uk/">I would write this to you directly via your site feedback page but it is throwing Access database errors. The email appears to be down as well.</q> Okay, maybe standards don&#8217;t have much to do with the back-end of a site, but Access?!

Shame, shame, shame. I hope the folks in the Magic Kingdom wake up and smell the rot soon before they start losing money because of a really bad decision.
