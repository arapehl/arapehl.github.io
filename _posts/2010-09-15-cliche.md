Busy, busy, busy. There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. All the reasons in the world, yet two weeks into the month and the September issue of [Webstyle Magazine][1] is still sitting on the shelf, waiting for me to finish prepping it for release. Better late than never, right? Maybe I&#8217;ll skip an issue and catch up.

All the articles are in, the feature interview is done&#8211;some really great content, and I owe it to the contributors to get this issue out the door. Almost there too, but the devil&#8217;s in the details. There&#8217;s some proof-reading left to be done, a couple of images to be sourced, a bit of tagging and categories, etc&#8230;

But look at the time, only a few minutes to get ready for work.
