Purple Motion used the line in [Second Reality][1], and I&#8217;d always wondered where he&#8217;d gotten it from. Then Wikipedia came along and I found out that it was a quote from [Admiral William H. P. Blandy][2], but reading about it wasn&#8217;t as cool as actually [finding the clip on YouTube][3] a few moments ago. (I&#8217;ve embeded it below for your viewing pleasure.)

As an added bonus, the video gives us a view into what people were scared of at the time, kind of like the black hole hysteria surrounding the [LHC][4] today.
