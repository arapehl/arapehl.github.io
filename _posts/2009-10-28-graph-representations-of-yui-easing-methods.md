First, for those who didn&#8217;t get the news already, I&#8217;m now working at Yahoo! as a Front-end Engineer on the Yahoo! Mail team. As a result, I&#8217;m presently down in Sunnyvale, California for a week of orientation and training. In a quirk of perfect timing, my visit coincides with the first ever [YUICONF][1], the first day of which just ended.

The last event of the day was a &#8220;show and tell&#8221; where people showed what they&#8217;d built using YUI. [Philip Tellis][2] showed off his [YUI port of the Flot graphing library][3] which got me thinking of a little utility I&#8217;d written a while back. When I was writing the animation chapter of the YUI section of [Professional JavaScript Frameworks][4], I needed a way to accurately display what the animation easing methods looked like. So I wrote a little utility that basically drew a chart and passed some linear data through a selected YUI easing method, then plotted the points. Voila! [Instant accurate representation][5]!
