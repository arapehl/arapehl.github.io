[Revision3][1], a TV network on the web, was [shut down][1] this past Memorial Day weekend due to a [DoS attack][2]. Though attacks of this nature are an unfortunate reality of being a popular site on the web, this one was a little different.

Normally this sort of attack is mounted by the quintessential &#8220;bad guy&#8221; or group of bad guys who either have an ax to grind, a point to make, or just want to prove their prowess to their peers. As it turns out, *this* attack was perpetrated by worst kind of bad guy, the kind that claims to be good on the outside, yet is really rotten on the inside.

<a href="http://www.mediadefender.com/" rel="nofollow">MediaDefender</a> is that bad guy. A subsidiary of <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/" rel="nofollow">Artist Direct</a> ([ARTD.OB][3]), they are (according to their home page) <q cite="http://www.mediadefender.com/">the leading provider of anti-piracy solutions in the emerging Internet-Piracy-Prevention (IPP) industry.</q> Which is strange since on the same page they also claim to be <q cite="http://www.mediadefender.com/">harnessing the power of user-generated content, social networking, and search technology&#8230;to successfully reach out to the 300 Million aggregate unique monthly P2P users.</q>

So what&#8217;s their business model? Preventing piracy, or marketing via P2P? Well, according to Jim Louderback, CEO of Revision3, who chronicled the attack, <q cite="http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3">Revision3 was hosting thousands of MediaDefender torrents improperly injected into [their] corporate server</q> and that MediaDefender&#8217;s <q cite="http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3">servers freaked out, and went into attack mode&#8230;[w]hen [they] closed off their backdoor access.</q>

Oops, so is MediaDefender engaged in questionable practices themselves? Worse still, like corrupt cops, are they beating the snot out of the people they&#8217;re supposed to be protecting when the protection money (read: access to your Bittorrent tracking server) isn&#8217;t paid? Shame on you MediaDefender.

According to Louderback, <q cite="http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3">[d]enial of service attacks are illegal in the US under 12 different statutes, including the Economic Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,</q> and <q cite="http://revision3.com/blog/2008/05/29/inside-the-attack-that-crippled-revision3">the FBI is looking into the matter</q>. Good for you Revision3.

And in case you&#8217;re interested, MediaDefender&#8217;s client list has included Sony, Universal Music, and the RIAA and MPAA. Surprised? Didn&#8217;t think so.
