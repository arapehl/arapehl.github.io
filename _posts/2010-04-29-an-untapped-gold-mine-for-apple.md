I don&#8217;t think Apple fully appreciates how OCD their clientele can get about the look of their products. The moment an iPhone gets dinged, or a Magic Mouse gets scuffed it loses its &#8230; magic. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if Apple offered a service where you could drop into an Apple store and for a nominal fee swap out your product for a shiny new one? Then Apple could refurbish the swapped product and sell it again.

Often times all a product needs is a new outer casing. How much could it possibly cost Apple to replace and recycle the outer shell of an iPhone or other product? I&#8217;m just saying, Steve, if you&#8217;re reading this, you could be making even more dough while making our world shinier.
