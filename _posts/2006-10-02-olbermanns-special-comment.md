I just watched &#8220;[Good night, and Good Luck][1]&#8221; tonight and then later the same night came across this video&#8211;which seems to come straight from the Edward R. Murrow mold. Then, to confirm my suspicion of the Murrow parallel, he ends his comment with &#8220;good night, and good luck&#8221;. Classic. :-)

You know, in the movie, the Senate ended up investigating McCarthy&#8230;
