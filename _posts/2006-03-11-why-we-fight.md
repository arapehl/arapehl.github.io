Am I the only one who, up until I saw Eisenhower&#8217;s farewell address, didn&#8217;t know that he was in fact warning *against* the military industrial complex? [Why We Fight &#8211; A Film By Eugene Jarecki][1] looks like it&#8217;s going to be a very informative film&#8211;and I&#8217;m not even an American.
