  <img id="image248" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/centrios.jpg" alt="Centrios Noise Reduction Earbuds" />I recently purchased an iPod. It came with those standard white Apple earbuds&#8211;why they only come in white while the iPods themselves come in an array of colours is beyond me. I quickly found that my ear canals are either freakishly misshapen, or that the earbuds are badly designed because they kept slipping out of my ears. So I came to the conclusion that I&#8217;d need to get either in-ear earphones, or ones that hook onto the outside of my ear.

I walked into *[The Source (by Circuit City)][1]* today looking for a decent pair of earphones. As I was explaining to the sales guy what the nature of my problem was, I started pulling the Apple earphones out of my pocket to show them to him at which point he proceeded to grab them from my hand and put one in **his ear**! This of course was *after* I was already told by another sales guy of their &#8220;earphone sales are final due to hygenic reasons&#8221; policy&#8211;which **this** guy repeated to me himself after selling me a pair!

I was disgusted. I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was seeing. He may as well have been peeing on my leg. I was shocked. Anyway, I settled on [these][2]. I **should** have smacked the guy and walked out of the store, but I&#8217;m an impatient shopaholic type.

Has anything like this ever happened to you?
