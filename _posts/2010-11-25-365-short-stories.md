Writing fiction is a passion of mine&#8211;or at least it would be if I ever did anything about it. Sure, I&#8217;ve dabbled a bit here and there.[ I wrote a bunch of stuff for a NaNoWriMo][1] a few years back. But I&#8217;ve never made a sustained effort at being an author of fiction. Lately, I haven&#8217;t even been writing little bits here and there. I&#8217;m completely out of practice and I fear my creative muscles have begun to atrophy. So much so that I doubt I could even formulate a proper sentence now, much less churn out a novel.

I often try to think up story ideas but don&#8217;t flesh them out. As a result they remain embryonic. I need practice. I need to work out the mental muscles it takes to write a good, nuanced, complex yet easily read story. So in an effort to get the creative juices flowing, I&#8217;m committing to writing a short story a day for the next year. It&#8217;s a big commitment to be sure, especially for someone who&#8217;s always (ostensibly) busy. But then, as a teacher of mine once told me, nothing worth doing in life is going to be easy.

So there you have it. I hope you&#8217;ll come along for the journey. Who knows, you may even be entertained!
