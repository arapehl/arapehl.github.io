Far be it from me to be a proponent of &#8220;viral marketing&#8221; a lot of which amounts to nothing more than spam, but I think the idea for Twitterface is a lot more usefl than just blanketing people with garbage Tweets. **Bear with the first half of the presentation** if you know what Twitter is (**or skip to slide 113**), I had to make sure my audience knew what I was talking about.

Basically the idea behind Twitterface is to use Twitter as an interface for your web app. So whenever a user of your service or app interacts with you through Twitter, they&#8217;re automatically advertising for you to all of their followers. Check out the presentation for more details.

So without further ado:
