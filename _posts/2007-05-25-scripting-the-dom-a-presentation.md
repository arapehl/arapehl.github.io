I gave a presentation titled Scripting the DOM at [work][1] today. I have to admit, public speaking looks a lot easier than it is. That being said, I&#8217;ve got to give much props to the many [Tanteks][2], [Jeremys][3] and [Christians][4] on the speaking circuit who share with such passion and make it seem so effortless.

Without further ado, here&#8217;s my presentation:
