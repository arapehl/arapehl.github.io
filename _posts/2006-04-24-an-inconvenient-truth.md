I was just going through my blogroll and came upon Jason Kottke&#8217;s post entitled [An Inconvenient Truth][1]. It&#8217;s about a movie coming out about former Vice President Al Gore&#8217;s push to raise awareness about global warming. The facts&#8211;that I&#8217;m sure most of us are not aware of&#8211;are scary to say the least. If you aren&#8217;t a reader, then at least check out the [trailer][2] and then visit the [movie site][3].

Here are some quick facts from the site:

> *   The number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has almost doubled in the last 30 years.
> *   Malaria has spread to higher altitudes in places like the Colombian Andes, 7,000 feet above sea level.
> *   The flow of ice from glaciers in Greenland has more than doubled over the past decade.
> *   At least 279 species of plants and animals are already responding to global warming, moving closer to the poles.
> 
> If the warming continues, we can expect catastrophic consequences:
> 
> *   Deaths from global warming will double in just 25 years&#8211;to 300,000 people a year.
> *   Global sea levels could rise by more than 20 feet with the loss of shelf ice in Greenland and Antarctica, devastating coastal areas worldwide.
> *   Heat waves will be more frequent and more intense.
> *   Droughts and wildfires will occur more often.
> *   The Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summer by 2050.
> *   More than a million species worldwide could be driven to extinction by 2050.
