It&#8217;s funny, I was thinking about this just this morning. It seems like [InPhase Technologies][1] has built a [Holographic Video Storage][2] system (link via [Brainfuel][3]). I first saw this tech on [3-2-1 Contact][4] over 10 years ago. At the time the media they were writing on what looked like a small crystal. It looks now that they&#8217;ve finally figured it all out. I can&#8217;t wait till these come out for the general public.
