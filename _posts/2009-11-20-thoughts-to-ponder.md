I received this email today and thought it to be quite clever.

&#8212;

1. I think part of a best friend&#8217;s job should be to immediately clear your computer&#8217;s history if you die. 

2. Nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you realize you&#8217;re wrong. 

3. I totally take back all those times I didn&#8217;t want to nap when I was younger. 

4. There is great need for a sarcasm font. 

5. How the hell are you supposed to fold a fitted sheet? 

6. Was learning cursive really necessary? 

7. Map Quest needs to start their directions on #5. I&#8217;m pretty sure I know how to get out of my neighborhood. 

8. Obituaries would be a lot more interesting if they told you how the person died. 

9. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I wasn&#8217;t at least kind of tired. 

10. Bad decisions make good stories. Horrible decisions make even better ones! 

11. You never know when it will strike, but there comes a moment at work when you know that you just aren&#8217;t going to do anything productive for the rest of the day. 

12. Can we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after Blue Ray? I don&#8217;t want to have to restart my collection&#8230;again. 

13. I&#8217;m always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to the ten-page paper that I swear I did not make any changes to. 

14. &#8220;Do not machine wash or tumble dry&#8221; means I will never wash this &#8212; ever.

15. I hate it when I miss a call by the last ring (Hello? Hello? !@#% it!), but when I immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail. What&#8217;d you do after I didn&#8217;t answer? Drop the phone and run away? 

16. I hate leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of importance the entire day. What a waste. 

17. I keep some people&#8217;s phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call. 

18. My 4-year old son asked me in the car the other day &#8220;Dad what would happen if you ran over a ninja?&#8221; How the hell do I respond to that? 

19. I think the freezer deserves a light as well. 

20. I disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with a Budweiser than Kay.
