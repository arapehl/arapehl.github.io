[SXSWi][1] is underway as I write this and I feel incredibly left out. I wish I had signed up and gone but alas, it&#8217;s too late. Perhaps the [podcasts][2] and blog coverage will be enough, even if all they do is further fuel my feelings of isolation.

For all of you who are in a similar situation, you can follow along vicariously through these people:

*   [Nathan Smith][3] 
    *   [SXSW, Halfway][4]

*   [Jonathan Snook][5] 
    *   [SXSW 2006 Day 2][6]
    *   [SXSW 2006 Day 1][7]
*   [Kartooner][8] 
    *   [SXSW: Days One and Two][9]
*   [Jeffery Zeldman][10] 
    *   [SXSW II][11]
    *   [SXSW I][12]
