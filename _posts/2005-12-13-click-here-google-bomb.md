Everyone knows about the [&#8220;failure&#8221; Google bomb][1], but there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s even more sinister. In early November I wrote about the [creation of hyperlinks][2] and how nonsensical anchor text can do more harm than good. Well, that, and the infamous &#8220;failure&#8221; Google bomb got me wondering what effects bad hyperlink creation could be having on search results. That&#8217;s when I typed [&#8220;Click Here&#8221; into Google][3]. Surprise, surprise. The results page is a collection of all the most popular web browser plugin makers. Why? Because nobody makes a hyperlink that says &#8220;Please download [Real Player][4].&#8221; Everyone instead writes, &#8220;[Click here][3] for Real Player.&#8221;

Does anyone else have a Google &#8220;side-effect&#8221; that they&#8217;ve found?
