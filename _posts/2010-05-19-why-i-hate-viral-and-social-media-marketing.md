I hate social media marketing. It gets on my nerves because it&#8217;s fake. It&#8217;s a bunch of impostors crashing our party, trying to turn a buck. Think of it like the friend or family member at a social gathering who&#8217;s trying to push a product on anyone he can corner. It&#8217;s out of context and it certainly isn&#8217;t welcome.

Social media is a subset of the web. It defines the types of sites that allow people to socially interact with one another. And just like at a party with friends, the same social etiquette applies online. The guy pushing his fantastic pyramid scheme isn&#8217;t welcome.

On the flip-side, a lot of business *can* get done among friends and acquaintances&#8211;even strangers, at a social gathering. You could be sitting with a bunch of people and find out that the person next to you makes websites, and &#8220;hey, I need a website, let&#8217;s talk!&#8221;

I also hate &#8220;viral marketing&#8221; because it too is fake. You don&#8217;t walk into a room and say, &#8220;hey guys, you have to hear this joke, it&#8217;s the best joke you&#8217;ve ever heard! It&#8217;s so awesome you&#8217;re going to tell all your friends about it, and they&#8217;re going to tell their friends, until my whole target demo&#8230; err&#8230; everyone hears it!&#8221; If you&#8217;ve ever found yourself in that awkward situation you&#8217;ll know that the joke usually sucks.

On the other hand, if you tell someone a joke just because you find it funny&#8211;and it makes sense to do so in the social setting you find yourself in&#8211;and they find it funny, they immediately want to tell their friends. That&#8217;s natural. That&#8217;s viral.

So basically, I hate social media and viral marketing because it&#8217;s fake, it&#8217;s forced and it&#8217;s usually perpetrated by people who wouldn&#8217;t spend more than a minute of their personal time on the sites their invading.
