Of all the conversations we had one thing that he told me remains burned into my brain to this day, &#8220;don&#8217;t be afraid&#8230;&#8221;. Now I&#8217;ve put the ellipsis there because I can&#8217;t quite remember exactly what the phrase was, but we were talking about computers and my fear of breaking something while exploring them. His advice was basically that you&#8217;ll never learn if you&#8217;re afraid of doing something wrong. The essence of which I&#8217;ve realized is that <em>fear will inhibit learning</em>.

> Fearest not and thou shalt learn

I can&#8217;t tell you how often I&#8217;ve looked at an article or a spec and thought to myself, &#8220;Oh my God, this is insane, I can&#8217;t understand this,&#8221; and it&#8217;s the times that I&#8217;ve plowed through and actually tried reading through it that I&#8217;ve learned something. The same thing happens whenever I read some of the more brilliant members of the web development community&#8217;s blogs and think to myself &#8220;what the hell are they talking about?&#8221; My first instinct is always to just close the window and move on. &#8220;This stuff&#8217;s way over your head Ara.&#8221; But by persisting, I&#8217;m able to fight that urge to ignore the difficult and actually learn something. Or at the very least get a primer on the subject for the next time I come across a similar article on the same thing.

I&#8217;ve come to realize that it has a lot to do with how you see yourself. If you&#8217;re a fatalist at heart and think that all that complicated stuff is for geniuses, you&#8217;ll forever remain a newbie. And I&#8217;ve got news for you, the more you learn the more the magic fades and you realize that a large number of those &#8220;geniuses&#8221; weren&#8217;t geniuses at all, just more learned. If you commit to not being afraid of a subject that&#8217;s &#8220;too complicated&#8221; and decide to dive head first into it instead, the worst that can happen is that you&#8217;ll learn something. And the more you play around with the stuff, the more you&#8217;ll learn. Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be the one writing the articles.
