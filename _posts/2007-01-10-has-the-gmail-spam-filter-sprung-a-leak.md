Because I get about ten to twenty emails a day (that Gmail&#8217;s spam filter doesn&#8217;t catch) informing me of my phenomenal luck. Prior to that, Gmail did a very good job of dealing with the spam deluge. Lately though, its performance has been less than stellar.

Does anyone have any insight into the recent upsurge in spam?

**Update**: Forget it, I just created a filter that catches any email with the words *lottery*, *winner*, and *claim* in it and throws it in the trash. I just don&#8217;t have the patience to wait for gmail to plug the leak.
