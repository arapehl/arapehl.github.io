As you may have noticed, the site looks a little different. My focus was primarily the layout and structure of the pages rather than the design&#8212;though one could argue that they go hand in hand, I am nonetheless taking a phased approach.

The main thing that I wanted to accomplish was to do away with the clutter. There was just too much stuff in the sidebar. So I took all of the links&#8212;like blogroll links etc&#8230;&#8212; and put them into their own page, likewise with the archives/categories as well as the syndication links (see navigation above). I also wanted to let the text breath so I introduced a *lot* of white-space. It isn&#8217;t much to look at I know. But it&#8217;s a start on which I&#8217;ll be able to build slowly.

Your feedback is always appreciated.

I&#8217;ll try and get them fixed up real soon. Please bear with me as I get this thing done. :-)</ins>
