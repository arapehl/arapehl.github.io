Regardless of who you are, that number remains fixed. Whether you&#8217;re rich or poor, successful, a failure, boring or flamboyant, male, female, gay or straight, black, white, orange or green, you get 24 hours. No matter what you do you can&#8217;t change that (well, unless you go into orbit, but let&#8217;s not go there). No amount of money will add even a second more to your day (well, again, unless you go into orbit, but I digress) . So the question needs to be asked, how do you spend the 24 hours you&#8217;re given every single day of your life?

24 hours sounds like a lot of time, until you factor in all that you have to do in a day. For example, you can&#8217;t go on for very long without sleep. That will take anywhere from 6 to 8 hours out of your day. Then there&#8217;s work and the commute, 8 to 10 hours. You&#8217;ve got to eat and drink, say that takes an hour or two. That leaves you with anywhere from 4 to 9 hours of time to yourself. Then again, if you go to the bathroom, do chores and spend time with your family you might only be left with a couple of hours at most, if that.

So with the limited amount of time you&#8217;ve got left, what do you do? And how effectively can you do it? I mean, if you want to write a book, learn a new language, take a class, maintain a blog, start a new company, write a program, work out, paint, read, or work on an anti-gravity device in your basement you need time. Some people eat on the go, others sleep less. What do you do?

I often get caught up with several activities that I&#8217;d like to pursue and ultimately every one of them suffer due to a lack of time. The suffering is usually proportionate to the amount of stuff I try to do. I started [writing a book][1] in November of last year (well actually a couple of years ago, but really took a shot at it in November) but that came to a screeching halt when my time became fragmented. My blog&#8217;s recently suffered a similar fate. I&#8217;ve got at least a million different web projects I&#8217;d like to embark on, several ideas I&#8217;d like to write about and explore, and at least a few learning endeavors I&#8217;d like to pursue but have zero time to do any of them. I&#8217;m constantly struggling with the finiteness of time, which is why I look forward to retirement.

So, how do you deal with the finiteness of time?
