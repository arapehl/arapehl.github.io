*Oh my head. I&#8217;m going to throw up.*

*&#8230;*

*Okay, that was pleasant. Oh my head. **Where am I? **What&#8217;s &#8230; **Oh God, no. Not that.*

*I mean, wow, it worked&#8230; but oh God! **Is this&#8230;?*

*Oh God!*

*Don&#8217;t panic. Don&#8217;t panic! Nothing good has ever come from panicking. Okay, okay, deep breaths &#8230; in &#8230; out &#8230; in &#8230; out &#8230; in &#8230; oh God, oh God! I&#8217;m so screwed. *

*No, stop&#8230; think this through. Think!*

*Okay, assets, what do I have? Nothing! I have nothing! Oh God.*

*No! Wait&#8230; think. Okay, I have knowledge. I know what no one else does. I figured my way into this, I can figure my way out. **I can rebuild. I need to rebuild.*

*Rebuild? Are you serious? How the hell do you expect to rebuild!? With what?*

*No, no, there&#8217;s always a way. Smith did it on Lincoln island. It&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;ll take time and effort but it&#8217;s possible. *

*Are you insane? That was fiction!*

*No. Wait! That guy&#8230; what was his name? In that video. He did it. He built a telegraph from scratch. Sure, it took him forever, but it *is* possible. *

*But this isn&#8217;t a simple telegraph. Who are you kidding? It&#8217;ll take you forever, even if it *was* possible.*

*Well, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got anything *else* to do. I&#8217;ll just spend my time working on getting out.*

*No, wait&#8230; you idiot. Survival. You need food, shelter&#8230; *

*&#8220;*Crap.&#8221;

*Wonderful. First person to discover time travel and I get stuck in the mesozoic.*

***Wait&#8230; What was that sound?*
