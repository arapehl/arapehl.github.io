&#8220;Area 51!? Did you just say we&#8217;re going to land in Area 51!?&#8221; Mark was panicking. They&#8217;d taken off from McCarran in Vegas in a Cessna Skycatcher heading north in favorable weather. About a hundred miles into their flight, the low fuel alarm went off. The gauge had shown a full tank when they&#8217;d departed. Something was wrong and the safest thing to do was find a place to land. The trouble was, the ground below was largely mountainous desert. What they needed was a stretch of highway or a dry lakebed. Sure enough, there was a dry lakebed nearby, it just happened to belong to the U.S. Government. It also happened to be where they developed the U-2, SR-71 and F-117 Nighthawk. Yes, it was Area 51.

&#8220;Relax! It&#8217;s gonna be fine,&#8221; replied Kyle. Kyle Johnson was the charismatic type who was confident in any situation. Unlike most people though, he usually had reason to be. A prodigy who loved to party, he&#8217;d played a pivotal role in the founding of numerous well-known tech companies. As a result, he belonged to that highly exclusive club of thirty-something billionaires.

Mark was a reporter for Forbes doing a cover story on Kyle when the latter suggested taking a joyride in his new Cessna. Of course Mark agreed, which brought them to their current predicament. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m gonna give the dealer hell about this fuel gauge thing,&#8221; laughed Kyle. He reached over and tuned the plane&#8217;s radio to the guard frequency which was reserved for emergencies.

Just as he&#8217;d switched the radio over, &#8220;Cessna 162CE, if you read, squawk ident.&#8221; How the hell did they know his tail number? Then it occurred to him that there might be a fighter shadowing them. He looked out to the side of the plane and sure enough, there was an F-16. He reached over to the plane&#8217;s transponder and hit the &#8220;ident&#8221; button which caused their blip on the tower&#8217;s radar screen to blossom. Being asked to &#8220;ident&#8221; themselves was a way for the tower to confirm that their message was being heard&#8211;in case of a broken radio. It was then that the tower cut in, &#8220;162CE, squawk 0363.&#8221; Kyle complied and switched to 0363.

&#8220;Uhhh, tower, we&#8217;re out of McCarran. We&#8217;re out of fuel and need to put down. Possible busted fuel gauge being the cause.&#8221;

&#8220;Negative, 162CE. This is a restricted military airbase. You can&#8217;t land here.&#8221;

&#8220;Tower, get your base commander and tell him Kyle Johnson needs to land his crippled Cessna. Like I said, we&#8217;re out of station nine.&#8221;

&#8220;Standby, 162.&#8221; *Station nine* was code that they normally used to identify McCarran. If this guy knew it, maybe he wasn&#8217;t some crackpot looking to land his Cessna in &#8220;Area 51.&#8221;

&#8220;162, standing by. Roger,&#8221; he said smiling at Mark. What Mark didn&#8217;t know was that Kyle had headed a classified project on that very base a while back. Among other things, he&#8217;d written the fly by wire software for one of their experimental aircraft. The kind that normally gets mistaken for a UFO when being tested in civilian airspace. Plus, being the charismatic sort, he&#8217;d made fast friends with the base commander. It was highly unorthodox, but then, that was Kyle.

&#8220;Uhhh, 162, this is Groom Lake tower. You&#8217;re clear to land runway one left.&#8221;

&#8220;Runway one left. Roger,&#8221; smiled Kyle. &#8220;Listen, Mark, you should know. They&#8217;re going to put a black bag over your head and throw you in the back of a van then drive you off base. Who knows, they might do it to me too. But hey, we&#8217;ll be alive. I promise, I&#8217;ll make it up to you.&#8221;
