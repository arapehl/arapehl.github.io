As I&#8217;ve stated in the past and on my [about page][1], I was a part of the [demo scene][2] back in the &#8217;90s, and as I again mentioned [yesterday][3], I&#8217;m a big Doctor Who fan. Two seemingly separate universes. Both geeky in their own rite, but both really separate universes nonetheless.

Well, as it happens, I was searching the web for Doctor Who theme song remixes yesterday, you know, so I could get into the Who mood for the upcoming season when I came across the [whomix][4] site. It&#8217;s got nearly 200 Doctor Who theme song remixes, and one of them is &#8220;[Unreal Who (I am a Timelord)][5]&#8220;. 

Now anyone who knows anything about the demo scene knows that [Future Crew][6] were pioneers in the early &#8217;90s (at least on the PC). Their defining demos were &#8220;Unreal&#8221; and &#8220;[Second Reality][7]&#8221; (Unreal ][). *Unreal Who* takes the classic Doctor Who theme and mashes it up with the Second Reality tune in a masterful remix that I consider a truly cherished find on the &#8216;net. Thank you Miguel F Ettema, you are truly a genious in my books.
