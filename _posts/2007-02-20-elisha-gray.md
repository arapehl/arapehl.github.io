  <img src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/elisha_gray.jpg" alt="Elisha Gray" />A week ago I wrote of my <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/2007/02/13/stikkit-i-snoozed-i-lost/">lost opportunity</a> due to procrastination. Now, less than a day after releasing my <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/2007/02/20/automated-vertical-flip-image-reflection/">reflection script</a> I find that someone had <a href="http://cow.neondragon.net/index.php/1343-Reflectionjs-16">done the same <em>exact</em> thing</a> (in fact better because it supports IE) last summer! The worst part is, it&#8217;s so identical it looks like I ripped the guy off!

Sigh. Back to the ol&#8217; drawing board&#8230;
