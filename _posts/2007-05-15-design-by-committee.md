Yet it only dawned on me yesterday that this is exactly how we build the spec for the web. From <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">CSS</a> to <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/">Microformats</a>, we not only design the spec by committee, but we&#8217;ve managed to take the idea of a committee to a whole new level. Now, anyone from the four corners of the world with an internet connection and an email address can contribute.

Is this wrong? Is it really a bad idea? After all the web is supposed to be a democracy of sorts. There isn&#8217;t an internet police and if everyone has a voice, then no one can complain. But it was Molly who asked only a few days ago <q cite="http://www.molly.com/2007/05/07/molly-asks-you-html-haslayout-and-the-meaning-of-framework/"><a href="http://www.molly.com/2007/05/07/molly-asks-you-html-haslayout-and-the-meaning-of-framework/">What are the most critical issues we need to solve regarding the current <em>fragmenting state of HTML</em> (and XHTML)?</a></q> (emphasis mine). I can&#8217;t help but think that eliminating the approach of a design by committee wouldn&#8217;t be a good start. After all, [Douglas Crockford][1] single handedly wrote the [spec][2] for [JSON][3].

So what do we do? Do we lock a few brains up in a room until they come up with the next version of HTML? Or do we watch the community continue to fragment into [HTML 5][4], [XHTML 2][5] and who knows what else? What are your thoughts?
