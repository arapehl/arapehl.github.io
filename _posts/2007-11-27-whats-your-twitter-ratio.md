It always bothers me when I get a Twitter notification telling me that someone is following me only to find that they&#8217;re following 17,000 people. It&#8217;s always seemed insincere to me. I&#8217;ve also noticed that some people have tons of followers who follow very few people themselves. I feel that these numbers speak a lot about the people to whom they belong, which is how I came up with what I call the Twitter ratio.

It&#8217;s simple, take someone&#8217;s &#8220;followers&#8221; number and divide it by their &#8220;following&#8221; number. What you end up with is that persons Twitter ratio. So for example, at the time of this writing I have 120 followers and I&#8217;m following 124 people. That gives me a ratio of 0.97. Now take the person who is following 17,000 people but only has say, 2,000 followers, they&#8217;d have a ratio of 0.12. On the other hand, someone who is following only 100 people but who himself has 2,500 followers would have a ratio of 25.

The question is how to interpret these numbers. My initial take on this is, if you&#8217;ve got a really low ratio then to me you come off as a spammer. A really high ratio makes you a twittersnob. But if your ratio hovers at around the one to three mark, then you aren&#8217;t spamming and you aren&#8217;t a snob.

Am I interpreting these numbers incorrectly? What&#8217;s your take?
