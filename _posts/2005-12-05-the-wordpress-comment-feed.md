The only way to efficiently keep up with more than just a handful of blogs is to [subscribe to their feeds][1]. And if you&#8217;re anything like me, you leave comments on most of the blogs you read. But how do you keep up with them? Most often you&#8217;ll get a reply to your comment, but unless you deliberately go back to read that particular blog entry you&#8217;ll never catch it.

Once you&#8217;ve marked the post as &#8220;read&#8221; in your feed reader, it&#8217;s gone, it doesn&#8217;t show up anymore. And readers don&#8217;t set posts as &#8220;updated&#8221; when new comments are added, only when the author modifies the post&#8217;s contents. So how can you keep up with comments? Well, [WordPress][2] has a great feature where all you need to do is add &#8220;`/feed`&#8221; at the end of any post&#8217;s URI and you automatically get its comment feed. Then just copy and paste that URI into your feed reader and whamo!, you&#8217;ll know any time there&#8217;s a new comment. So if any of your favourite Blogs run on WordPress, you&#8217;ll easily be able to follow their comments.

Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t seen any other blogging software offer the same thing.
