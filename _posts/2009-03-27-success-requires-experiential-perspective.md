Success in any undertaking requires what I call experiential perspective. Let me put it in tangible terms:you can&#8217;t build a successful site for the iPhone without being an iPhone user. You can&#8217;t run a forum for your company if you don&#8217;t spend any time on forums as a pass-time. You won&#8217;t build a successful website if you&#8217;re not an web enthusiast in your free time. Why? Because there&#8217;s a depth of experience and understanding that&#8217;s only attainable by doing. And often it&#8217;s that very experience and understanding that separates the true success stories from the rest of the crowd.
