Australia is experiencing [the worst wildfires][1] in their history, with a death toll expected to exceed 200.

[SitePoint][2], which is based in Melbourne, is having a [5-for-1 book sale][3] for 3 days in order to help out. That&#8217;s right, **five** books for the price of one! 100% of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to victims of the bushfires.

So if you like great books and want to help out a worthy cause, visit <http://sale.sitepoint.com/> and hit that &#8220;buy&#8221; button!
