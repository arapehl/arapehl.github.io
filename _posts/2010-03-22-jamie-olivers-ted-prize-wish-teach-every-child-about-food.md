Jamie Oliver, the well known chef, was given the [TED Prize][1] earlier this year. On top of receiving $100,000 for their cause, TED Prize recipients get &#8220;One Wish to Change the World.&#8221; This means that they get to make their wish of the diverse and talented folks who are at the TED conference. Jamie&#8217;s wish is to teach children about food and to fight obesity, the biggest preventable killer in America.

Do yourself a favour and watch this video, it could save your or a loved one&#8217;s life:
