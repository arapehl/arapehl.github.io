I just dropped in on the new [Seed Magazine][1] site after reading about its redesign on [Zeldman&#8217;s site][2]. After looking around a little I decided that I&#8217;d like to subscribe to its feed so as to keep up with what they publish. But try as I may, I couldn&#8217;t find that [famous feed icon][3], or a variation thereof. There&#8217;s a reason why standard icons exist, so that people can recognize something like a feed icon on whichever site they may be visiting. It doesn&#8217;t help anyone to ditch the icon and go with eight point text instead. Well, unless you really aren&#8217;t looking to attract readers.
