  <img id="image251" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/voicemail.jpg" alt="Google Talk Voicemail in Action" /><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google talk</a> has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/09/now-anyone-can-talk.html">voicemail</a> now?! I just tried calling a friend through Google Talk and after four rings I heard the distinctive double ring click of voicemail picking up after which a female voice came on and said: <q>The person you are trying to reach isn&#8217;t available, please leave a message after the meep, meeeep!</q>
</p>

Crazy.
