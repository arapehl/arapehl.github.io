I don&#8217;t know how often I&#8217;ve wanted to [retweet][1] someone&#8217;s tweet, only to find that after adding &#8220;RT @username&#8221; it no longer fits in 140 characters. If I&#8217;m adamant about retweeting it, I might try and pare it down a little, but now I&#8217;m wasting time and energy. I&#8217;m sure that if there were stats collected on retweeting dropoff, this is where people would be dropping off en masse.

The way to make tweets &#8220;retweet friendly&#8221; of course, is to subtract the number of characters it takes to write &#8220;RT @yourusername&#8221; from the 140 character limit. It&#8217;s quick math, but if you&#8217;re lazy like me, you can use [Retweetulator][2]. It&#8217;s a quick script I whipped up just for lazy folk like myself. Enjoy!
