I&#8217;m up to [episode 11 of the web dev digest][1] and I haven&#8217;t been able to get production time below three or four hours yet. This is getting very painful as I end up staying up quite late at night to produce the show. Do you have any experience with this sort of thing? Got any hints, tips or tricks to share? I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback (especially if you&#8217;re following the show)&#8230; please follow the show.. ;-)
