I just saw a video on [MSNBC.com][1] entitled &#8220;Vision for the space elevator&#8221; (embedded below), and I&#8217;ve got to say, it&#8217;s inspiring. If they can get the technology working, we&#8217;d actually be able to get into space without burning a billion dead dinosaurs on each trip.

Now if we could just focus our efforts on healing, feeding the and clothing the less fortunate on earth which doesn&#8217;t require research, just our resolve.
