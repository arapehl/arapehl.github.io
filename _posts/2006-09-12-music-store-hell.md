So I finally decided to go and give the 99 cent per song download thing a whirl. Wow, what a frustrating experience. First I tried to go through Windows Media Player&#8217;s built in browser. It suggested a music store called URGE. I figure, sure, why not. I searched for the song I was trying to find (&#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow / What a Wonderful World&#8221; by Israel Kamakawiwo&#8217;ole) but alas, that store didn&#8217;t carry it. Then I noticed that I could switch stores (still in Windows Media Player). So I figured, hey, MSN has a music store, lemme click on that! A few clicks later and I had the song I was looking for in my sights. I started typing in my credit card information only to get stuck on the State field. I couldn&#8217;t find my province in the list and I soon saw why. It was a US only store (thanks RIAA legal team!).

Using the Windows Media Player browser was just adding to the frustration of jumping through RIAA hoops, so I abandoned that and finally found the Canadian MSN music store (after enough effort to discourage any sane shopper) only to realize that the Canadian MSN music store didn&#8217;t carry the song I wanted! Great! Back to square one. All the while I&#8217;d been avoiding using iTunes because not only do they require you to download a 20+MB mammoth of an app. just to download their music (thanks Steve Jobs!), but they lock you in to iTunes *and* place ludicrous restrictions on you once you&#8217;ve purchased the song.

I was at the end of my rope. I wanted the song, so I relented, they had it *and* I was *allowed* to **buy** it. So I dutifully entered my o&#8217; so precious credit card information and clicked &#8220;download&#8221;. I finally got the song only to realize that I had somehow &#8220;authorized&#8221; it&#8217;s use on 2 out of 5 PCs. WHAT THE&#8230; ?! Not only am I only allowed to play it on a limited number of PCs, but I&#8217;m also not allowed to burn more than 7 playlists with this song in it (at least that&#8217;s what I gathered from the ominous warning I received). Someone should give the boys in legal a medal.

All in all, I must say that purchasing a 99 cent song online was the most frustrating, belittling and annoying experience I&#8217;ve had with the &#8216;net in a while. It&#8217;s good to see that people are working overtime to put the customer first and make it easier for them to part with their hard earned dollars. No wonder there&#8217;s so much venom spewed at the RIAA. Forget &#8220;fortress America&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;fortress Recording Industry&#8221;.

At least I can listen to the song I bought&#8230; at least for now. Until I switch PCs a couple of times, which I tend to do. Then, well, I guess I&#8217;m out of luck.

Thanks RIAA! You&#8217;re the best!
