Google&#8217;s just released (in BETA of course) their [Reader][1]. As with a lot of their products, it&#8217;s an AJAX application. My first impression was that it was slow and buggy though it looked definitely like something you&#8217;d want to play around with. It&#8217;s just that there was only so long I could wait for my OPML to be imported. After a very long wait it managed to import it, but then navigating my feeds was like working on a 56k connection. But hey, it&#8217;s in BETA! So all is well. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll start getting better soon.
