As anyone who has had to reinstall their system several times in the span of a couple of months knows, like I&#8217;ve recently had to do, reconfiguring their apps every time gets to be a real pain.

A subtle update that was made to [Microsoft&#8217;s Live Messenger][1] a few versions ago which I&#8217;ve really come to love and appreciate is how it now stores nicknames and my avatar online. So all I have to do is log in, no matter the computer, and all my settings just show up.

I believe one of the first steps toward [cloud computing][2] becoming as ubiquitous as some are hoping is to move offline app settings online. Imagine getting on anyone&#8217;s computer, firing up an app, logging in with [OpenID][3] and blamo, there&#8217;s your custom configuration on someone else&#8217;s machine. Log out, and it&#8217;s gone.

Yeah, it might not be as sexy as [Docs][4] or [Bespin][5], but it would be freakin&#8217; useful.
