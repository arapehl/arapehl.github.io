  <img id="image229" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/bloglines.jpg" alt="Bloglines | My Feeds (1232 ) - Firefox" />I went on vacation for a week and during that time I didn&#8217;t get around to reading the 224 feeds that I normally read/scan daily. Five days into my vacation I fired up <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> and I had 1200+ posts sitting in my feed reader!!! (Actually I think it was more like 1600+ because I had already clicked on a whole set of feeds and inadvertently marked them as &#8220;read&#8221; before taking the screen capture of the 1232 posts.) Now, a normal person would simply click &#8220;mark all as read&#8221; and be done with it, but I&#8217;m not a normal person. I don&#8217;t want to accidentally miss something important. What if I skipped over a whole week of feeds and missed the launch of a new Web 2.0 site? Okay, I&#8217;m be facetious, but you know what I mean.

Having a mind that gravitates toward solving problems, I started thinking about how to tackle &#8220;feed buildup&#8221;. This lead me to ponder the nature of a feed: it isn&#8217;t email where a person addresses a piece of mail to you specifically and is waiting for an answer. Rather it&#8217;s akin to a TV broadcast&#8211;a newscast really&#8211;where the information just flows out to an audience. The difference between a broadcast and a feed however is that a broadcast is fleeting. A feed on the other hand (depending on the feed reader that you use) will accumulate in your reader until you read it. It&#8217;s almost like a broadcast/email hybrid in that it is sent out like a broadcast, but it&#8217;s caught like email. This works great if you read your feeds regularly, but if you only check them periodically you&#8217;ll be overwhelmed with an overflowing feed reader every time you load it up. To deal with this you&#8217;ll more than likely select everything and mark it all as read, or you&#8217;ll quickly scan through it and possibly miss information that you&#8217;d normally want to read.

The trouble of information overflow isn&#8217;t going to go away, and with the rapid adoption of feeds by every Tom, Dick and Harry on the web, it&#8217;s just going to get worse.

Solving this problem requires a rethinking of feed management. I&#8217;ve come up with a few disparate propositions but hardly anything revolutionary or conclusive. Rather, I&#8217;d like to spark a conversation through which solutions may be found.

So? What are your thoughts? I&#8217;d share mine, but it would quadruple the size of this post.
