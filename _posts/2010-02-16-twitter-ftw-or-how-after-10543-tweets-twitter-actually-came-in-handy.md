  <img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1005" title="Twitter bird by Frank Chimero" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/chimero-birdie-frank-chimero-150x150.png" alt="Twitter bird by Frank Chimero" width="150" height="150" />For those who may not know, I work for Yahoo! remotely. As such, my development box is 4,795 km (2,980 miles) to the west of me. Now, this isn&#8217;t normally a problem, except for today when my box decided to stop responding. And if you don&#8217;t believe in Murphy&#8217;s Law, today was also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Day_(United_States)">Presidents Day</a> in the U.S., which meant there was nobody in the office to hit the reset switch for me. Enter Twitter. After keeping myself busy with non-dev-box related work, I finally decided to send out <a href="http://twitter.com/ara_p/status/9150838912">a tweet asking for help</a>. I wasn&#8217;t holding my breath. But then, <a href="http://davidbcalhoun.com/">David Calhoun</a> came to my rescue with a <a href="http://twitter.com/franksvalli/status/9156084660">tweet of his own</a>. Let it be known that I&#8217;ve never even met him face to face, but this selfless, shining example of a human being went to my box and turned it on (turns out someone had turned it off).

Now, if that isn&#8217;t an awesome use of Twitter, then I don&#8217;t know what is. Thanks David, thanks Twitter, you made my day.
