[Zeldman switched][1], I upgraded. I&#8217;m now running on WordPress 2.0.2, thanks to [DreamHost][2]&#8216;s one click upgrade. I did upgrade previously by hand when WordPress 2 first came out (on my dev environment) and, well, that was a few months ago. You can understand that it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the quickest thing to do manually, and so thanks DreamHost for the one click upgrade!

Now, I wonder if everything works fine&#8230;

**Update:** Alas, all didn&#8217;t work out fine but it wasn&#8217;t because of WordPress or DreamHost. Here&#8217;s what happened:

*   Time = four minutes to quitting time at work
*   Cautious Ara: &#8220;Don&#8217;t press that upgrade button, something might go wrong&#8211;it always does&#8211;and you know you won&#8217;t have time to fix it&#8221;
*   Stupid, careless Ara: &#8220;Bah, whatever&#8221;
*   Click
*   Oops

I thought everything worked out after I ran the installer, and of course I had to write a quick post to announce that everything was okay. That post ended up having a problem and crashed. Silly me, I thought everything was broken but it was in fact that one post. It seems that I had inadvertently left a space in my [Ultimate Tag Warrior][3] tag list thereby creating havoc.

Long story short, everything&#8217;s (seems to be) fine.

**Update #2:** Seems my [feed redirect plugin][4] also needed updating so for a while there my feed was unavailable. Nice, nice. Okay, so that&#8217;s also fixed.
