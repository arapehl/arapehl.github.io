Am I the only one in my circle of friends who&#8217;s a Doctor Who fan? The new season&#8217;s about to start (in Canada) and it seems everyone I try and talk to about it is either clueless or apathetic toward it. If you&#8217;re a sci-fi fan and you haven&#8217;t checked out the series, you should. I mean, check out what they&#8217;ve done with the [Cybermen][1] in the upcoming season!

C&#8217;mon guys, it&#8217;s the Doctor!!!
