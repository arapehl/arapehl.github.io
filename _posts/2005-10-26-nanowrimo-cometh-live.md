Less than a week now and I&#8217;ll be entering the madness that is [NaNoWriMo][1]. This will be my first attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in thirty days. Actually, it&#8217;ll be my first &#8220;real&#8221; attempt to write a novel period! That&#8217;s 1666.6666&#8230; words a day. Seeing as how I only have two to three hours of time per day to do it in, it&#8217;ll definitely be a challenge. My strategy is as follows: write and don&#8217;t look back! I&#8217;ve also decided to do it **[live][2]** on my blog. So, if all goes well&#8212;and we all know it never does&#8212;I&#8217;ll be posting over sixteen-hundred words a day.

Let the madness begin!
