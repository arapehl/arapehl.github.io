I feel like someone gave me the keys to the NASA shuttle hangar and I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to get into the darn shuttle in order to replace an arm rest. To say nothing of the custom NASA screwdriver I&#8217;ll have to use to do the job&#8230; and I don&#8217;t even know where they keep their tools.
