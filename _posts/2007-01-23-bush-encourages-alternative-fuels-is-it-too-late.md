Bush delivering his 2007 State of the Union Address" />I&#8217;m sitting here on the computer with the 2007 State of the Union Address on in the background and I can vaguely make out George W. Bush encouraging Americans to use alternative fuels&#8211;including wood chips no less. It was then that the thought occurred to me, is it too late? Whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil">peak oil</a>, or <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">global warming</a>, for a Republican government who isn&#8217;t accustomed to listening to anyone to encourage the use of alternative fuels is a <em>very</em> scary indicator.

Then again, he&#8217;s pulling the 9/11 fear card now so it could just be another scare tactic.
