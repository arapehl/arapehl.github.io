Sometime last week I decided that I wanted to get a better grasp on [Yahoo! Pipes][1]. I noticed that the easiest thing to do with it was to mash up different feeds into one. So that&#8217;s what I did, I put all of my feeds into one master feed. Then I figured, &#8220;hey, why not label all the feed entries so that you can tell which entry comes from where at a glance&#8221;. That allowed me to play with Pipes&#8217; regex operator which was good practice. When I was done, I pumped the feed through feedburner so I could track it&#8217;s use and I sent it out to a bunch of friends. I figured that if anyone wanted to&#8211;for whatever reason&#8211;keep up with what I was doing, they&#8217;d just need to look at that feed. I named it &#8220;[Track Ara on the Web][2]&#8220;.

What&#8217;s very weird is that today [Jonathan Snook][3] [mentioned on twitter][4] how he&#8217;d enjoyed [Jeremy Keith&#8217;s post on his life stream][5], which made me do a double take. It *sounded* to me like he was talking about what I&#8217;d just done. Sure enough, it&#8217;s exactly the same concept, except that he&#8217;d done it 4 months ago, and [Jeremy&#8217;s][6] &#8220;stream&#8221; is rendered in a page so it&#8217;s pretty to look at. In fact, it seems like a lot of people have been doing this ([Jeff Croft&#8217;s stream][7], [Emily Chang&#8217;s Data Stream][8]) and I hadn&#8217;t the faintest clue. Cool.

Either way, [these][9] [coincidences][10] are starting to freak me out.
