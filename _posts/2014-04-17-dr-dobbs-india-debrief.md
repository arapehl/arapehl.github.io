My plane touched down in [Bangalore][1] at around 4:30 in the morning. I made my way out of the terminal to a driver waiting to drive me to the [conference hotel][2] where I&#8217;d be staying for the first leg of the conference. An hour&#8217;s drive later, I walked into my hotel room. The [conference][3] started in 3 hours. I tried my best to get some sleep but a combination of time-zone induced circadian confusion and anxiety at the thought of oversleeping kept me mostly awake. At 8 o&#8217;clock the first of my three alarms went off. Moments before the third one rang, the front desk called with my wake-up call. I flew halfway around the world, I wasn&#8217;t going to miss this.

I showered, got dressed and made my way to the lobby to get my badge. People were already gathered and registering. The atmosphere was professional and inviting. Things got underway at 9 o&#8217;clock with a keynote from [CollabNet][4]&#8216;s [Venkat Janardhanam][5]. We then split into two tracks. The first of my talks was at noon. I was following [Joydip Kanjilal][6] who was giving back to back talks on Node.js and new features in .NET. Did you know Node was single-threaded? I didn&#8217;t. Also, I&#8217;m not a .NET developer but memory fragmentation cleanup is actually pretty cool.

Noon rolled around and it was my turn to deliver the [first of my two talks][7]. It went really well with lots of Q&A during and after the session. I felt I connected with the crowd and that they got something out of it. My [jQuery workshop][8] was equally successful though unfortunately less of a workshop and more of a talk. I had too much content for the allotted 50 minutes so I had to fly through it pretty quickly, not giving the delegates much time to try out the examples. I determined to remedy that for the [Pune][9] leg of the trip where I&#8217;d be repeating both sessions. My talks delivered, I was free to attend the rest of the conference, learn and mingle with the delegates. It was also an opportunity to answer questions that attendees had regarding the topics I&#8217;d covered. I have to admit, the post-talk discussions were my favourite part of the conference.

I was soon leaving Bangalore and flying to Pune for a repeat performance to a new crowd at a new [venue][10]. This time, my JavaScript talk was immediately after the keynote. My jQuery workshop wasn&#8217;t till the end of the day though, giving me time to tweak things. I put together [an HTML page][11] that allowed delegates to follow along with the examples and copy and paste them into the console to quickly see the results of what was being taught. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t stick around to answer questions this time as a car was waiting to drive me to [Mumbai][12] for my flight out of India.

All in all, I feel the trip was a success. I was able to teach, learn and meet some [great][13] [people][14]. Many thanks to the organizers at [UBM India][15] for inviting me and I look forward to doing it again next year.
