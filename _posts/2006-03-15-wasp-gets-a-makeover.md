Andy Clarke ([Malarkey][1]) just [redesigned the WaSP site][2] and I&#8217;ve gotta say, that&#8217;s one bad mother&#8211;shut your mouth!

The new site has a bold, high contrast colour pallette and makes excellent use of space and typography. It runs on WordPress (yay for comments!&#8211;finally!!) and I don&#8217;t have to mention that the site is XHTML 1.0 Strict and [validates][3] (duh!).
