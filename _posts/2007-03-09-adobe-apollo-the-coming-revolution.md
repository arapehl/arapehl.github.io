<abbr>PDA</abbr>s unshackled us from our desktops and brought the convenience of email and text messaging to our palms. But on the desktop itself there has been a barrier of sorts between desktop applications and web applications. Short of a few specifically built desktop apps that have been written to connect to the web, we have yet to see a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; platform that bridges the two. Until now.

[Adobe Apollo][1] frees the web from the web browser and opens it up to interact with the desktop like nothing you&#8217;ve seen before. Christian Cantrell demonstrates the power of what Apollo can do [in a video posted on Google Video][2].

Now, the skeptic may point out that Java Applets tried to do this a few years back and was unsuccessful. But the skeptic would be missing one crucial difference between Java&#8217;s Applets and Apollo. Adobe has a mature development suite, allowing authors to quickly and easily build compelling and very useful components for use in Apollo with little more than a few clicks and some scripting knowledge. What&#8217;s more, the ubiquity of Flash and success of Flash adds that much more credibility to Apollo, not to mention greasing the wheels to adoption in the development community. Macromed&#8230; err&#8230; Adobe has &#8220;street cred&#8221;.

And a warning to all the nay sayers in the web development community who immediately balk at the thought of Flash. Apollo isn&#8217;t Flash. <q cite="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Apollo is a cross-OS runtime that allows developers to leverage their existing web development skills (Flash, Flex, HTML, Ajax) to build and deploy desktop <abbr title="Rich Internet application">RIA</abbr>’s.</q> 

Keep an eye on this up and comer, lest you be left in the dust of &#8220;the next big thing&#8221; on the web.
