&#8220;November One-Niner-Seven-Six Zulu, you are in restricted airspace. Change course immediately or you will be fired upon,&#8221; the disembodied voice said over the radio. Howard looked over his right shoulder out of the cockpit window and sure enough there was an F-16 falcon flying formation just a few feet off of his right wing. Turning his head he saw another one on his left wing. He was sure that there were at least two more behind them.

&#8220;Howard, what the hell are you doing?&#8221; his passenger panicked. Mike was sitting in the Gulfstream G550&#8217;s co-pilot&#8217;s chair, though he&#8217;d never piloted a plane in his life. He had ended up here through a decidedly bizarre turn of events and was now wondering if he&#8217;d live long enough to even soil himself.

&#8220;Six Zulu, this is your final warning. Either change course or we will be forced to open fire!&#8221; the voice was all business.

Howard figured he&#8217;d excited his guest long enough. He casually picked up the radio mic and keyed the switch. &#8220;This is November One-Niner-Seven-Six Zulu, requesting permission to land.&#8221;

&#8220;Six Zulu, are you out of your mind? You&#8217;re flying a civilian aircraft in restricted military airspace, now turn your plane around!&#8221;

&#8220;F-Sixteen, I repeat, request permission to land. Authorisation Papa Romeo X-Ray One,&#8221; Howard replied letting his finger off the switch. &#8220;Suck on that, hotshot,&#8221; he said under his breath and looked over at his passenger with a grin. Mike was as pale as a ghost and quite visibly shaken.

After several moments the radio crackled again, &#8220;Uhh, Six Zulu, permission is granted, sir. Change your heading to Zero-One-Niner and follow us in.&#8221;

&#8220;Roger that F-Sixteen.&#8221;

&#8220;What just happened?&#8221; Mike stammered.

&#8220;Relax buddy. Every air force base has a &#8216;hot list&#8217; of codes used by special ops types in case of an emergency.&#8221; He saw understanding in Mike&#8217;s face only to be replaced with confusion once more, although this time without the added contortion of panic.

&#8220;But how is it that you have a code?&#8221; His question only evoked a smile from Howard. Mike was beginning to learn that being with Howard was an exercise in frustration. Every answer he&#8217;d gotten for his questions thus far only resulted in more questions. A lot of which were dead ends. Just like this one.

Howard keyed the mic again, &#8220;Groom Lake tower, this is Jolly Jumper on approach bearing Zero-One-Niner, do you copy?&#8221;

&#8220;Roger Jolly Jumper, your signal is five-by-five. You are cleared for runway two left, winds are twenty knots south by southwest, just follow the lights in.&#8221; Just then a dim row of lights became visible on the horizon.
