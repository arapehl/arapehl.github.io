[Roger Johansson][1] of [456 Berea Street][2] pointed out a relatively common oversight in his post &#8220;[It’s alt attribute, not alt tag][3].&#8221;

Well, I was perusing the [Google Webmaster Guidelines][4] and came across this:

<blockquote cite="http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html">
  <p>
    Make sure that your TITLE and ALT tags are descriptive and accurate.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Now, I&#8217;m always one to give the benefit of the doubt, so I&#8217;ll assume they meant the title tag in the document head. But there is no such thing as an alt tag. So, it seems that even Google isn&#8217;t immune to such mistakes as these.
