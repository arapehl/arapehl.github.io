With [Twitter][1] suffering chronic [down time][2], people are beginning to [openly consider alternatives][3]. Yet Twitter&#8217;s user base is far from waning. Which raises a legitimate question, &#8220;how come [everyone is still on Twitter][4] when there are better alternatives available?&#8221;

The answer in my opinion, is a simple one: everyone is on Twitter. Think about it, what if you switch to [Jaiku][5] or [Pownce][6]? You&#8217;ll end up talking to yourself and missing out on all the action. Why? Because *everyone is on Twitter*.

In order for Twitter to suffer any loss, one thing will have to happen: [several][7] [big][8] [names][9] will have to simultaneously defect to a rival service which will likely trigger a mass exodus. Otherwise, limping or not, Twitter is here to stay.
