  <img src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/spam1.JPG" alt="Gmail spam screenshot" />In January I wrote about the apparent holes in <a href="http://arapehlivanian.com/2007/01/10/has-the-gmail-spam-filter-sprung-a-leak/">Gmail&#8217;s spam filter</a>, and since then the problem hasn&#8217;t gotten any better, in fact manually reporting spam has become a <a href="http://twitter.com/ara_p/statuses/5932304">new sport</a> for me&#8211;and not one that I&#8217;m particularly fond of.

Today, right in the middle of a chat with [Mathieu][1], something bubbled up from my subconsciousness and sparked a sneaking suspicion in me that Gmail may be deliberately using me as a human spam filter. In fact I&#8217;m almost positive they are. There&#8217;s no other way to explain *that* many &#8220;lottery winnings&#8221; notices leaking through the filter when even **I** can write my *own* filter in Gmail&#8211;using their own filter tool&#8211;to catch and throw most of them in the trash. Just looking for the keywords &#8220;lottery, win,&#8221; and &#8220;congratulations&#8221; or any combination of the three will block 90% of them alone. So they *must* be deliberately letting spam into my inbox in order to get a human to confirm it. What else can explain it?

Add to that the talk given by [Luis von Ahn][2], at the Googleplex, called [Human Computation][3] where he talks about a game he created that gets unsuspecting players to tag images on the web while having fun, and it becomes clear that the same thing is being done here&#8211;except it isn&#8217;t fun. Whose to say that the spam filter guys at Google weren&#8217;t sitting in on the talk and aren&#8217;t trying some variation of the technique in Gmail? I mean c&#8217;mon, *[Akismet][4]*&#8211;which I *love*&#8211;behaves like a proper learning spam filter, Gmail behaves like a drunken bouncer at a night club flirting with all the girls waiting in line while everyone else sneaks in behind him through the *front* door.
