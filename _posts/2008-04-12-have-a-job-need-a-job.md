Forget the pell mell job sites that offer every kind of job under the sun, Authentic Jobs is all about quality. 

The fact that Authentic Jobs is all about quality is also reflected in its design. The site&#8217;s founder [Cameron Moll][2] has applied his considerable design skills in putting together a very eye-friendly look which makes the whole experience of job hunting all the more pleasant.

Authentic Jobs in their own words:

<blockquote cite="http://authenticjobs.com/">
  <p>
    Authentic Jobs is a targeted destination for standards-aware designers and developers and the companies seeking to hire them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since 2005, qualified candidates have been applying for great opportunties at MSNBC.com, The Motley Fool, Turner Sports Interactive, ESPN, Phinney Bischoff, Garmin, Sony BMG and many other companies.
