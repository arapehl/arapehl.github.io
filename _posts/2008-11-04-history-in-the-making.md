Well, it&#8217;s ten minutes into November 4<sup>th</sup> and people have already begun voting (and Obama has already won Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, 15 to 6). There&#8217;s a part of me that really feels like history is being made today, that America is going to vote in its first African-American President, that the tide of the past eight abysmal years is finally going to change, that the U.S. is, dare I say it, on the cusp of a golden age. OK, well that last one might be a bit far fetched, but there&#8217;s no denying the palpable hope with which Barack Obama has inspired people with. 

If Barack wins today, I&#8217;ll be a very happy Canadian. If McCain <del>steals</del> somehow manages to pull of a monumental upset, the U.S. will be dead to me (at least for the next four years). It might sound extreme, but I know of no other way to avoid falling into a deep depression at the thought of four more years of the GOP at the helm. To say nothing of the potential that Sarah Palin will be a heartbeat from the Oval Office. \*shudder\*

To every American of legal voting age, if you haven&#8217;t already done so, go vote! Even if you&#8217;re not voting Obama&#8211;though I really hope you will. For one thing, you&#8217;re among the privileged few in this world who has the right to vote for who leads them. For another, it&#8217;s the most historic election you&#8217;re likely to witness in your lifetime. Be a part of it, exercise your right and cast your vote.
