So here it is. It isn&#8217;t finished yet, but I figured I&#8217;d take the [Jason Fried][1] approach and at least launch a &#8220;version 1&#8243; which I can incrementally improve upon as I go. I&#8217;ve already got a bunch of ideas of what I want to do, but if I were to wait till it all got done, I&#8217;d never have deployed the new design. Feel free to give me your feedback (including constructive criticism) as every word is appreciated. Thanks! :-)

Much thanks to [Enginerd][2], [Giornalista][3], [Mathias][4], [Mathieu][5], [Peter][6], and Schmu for their feedback, and [fastclemmy][7] for finding and posting the dev site.
