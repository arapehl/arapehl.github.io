After much blood, sweat and quite a few tears&#8211;okay, maybe not so much but at times it certainly felt that way&#8211;[Typecast][1] 1.4 (release) is out! The big feature with this release is the realtime masking. A lot of work went into replicating a normal input field&#8217;s funcitonality within the confines of a mask.

Coming up next will be the &#8220;ajaxification&#8221; of the Suggest behaviour and possibly regex support for the mask behaviour. Though it more than likely won&#8217;t be behaving the same so I may have to create a separate behaviour for it.

Anyhow, off to bed, lemme know what you think of the latest release.
