Okay, so I&#8217;ve been doing a little crying. I&#8217;ve come to the realisation that though I may be able to imagine wonderful designs in my head, I have yet to master the skills necessary to bring them to life. I *did* have a mini-breakthrough tonight however. Simple always seems to work well for me. On my previous site *the simple web* I had gone with a very white look, in the hopes of keeping the design clean. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t implement it all that well and it ended up looking very washed out. This time around I tried black (see image below) and I must say, I like the way it looks. I don&#8217;t know how practical it&#8217;ll be when I lay out the page content. But for a page head, I like it.

As you may have noticed, I&#8217;ve been playing around with reflection effects lately(all done by hand by the way). I like how a nice reflection conveys a clean, polished design. I also like how it&#8217;s an effect that hasn&#8217;t gone stale yet. At least I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback. Don&#8217;t be shy, leave a comment. I&#8217;m all for constructive criticism.
