That&#8217;s right; I&#8217;ve actually settled on a design and have been refining it in my secret fortified mountain lab. The bulk of it is done, but there&#8217;s still a lot of tweaking to be done. I&#8217;ll probably post a few screen shots soon. In the meanwhile, here&#8217;s a challenge for the adventurous among you: Try and find it.

What? Try and find it? Yeah, it&#8217;s accessible to the public; you just have to root around for it. Think you can find it while it&#8217;s still in dev? (No, this **isn&#8217;t** a challenge to hack my site so don&#8217;t do it). But see if you can locate my development environment. It isn&#8217;t protected. And yeah, you can post the address in a comment if you find it.

Have fun!
