You may be saying to yourself, &#8220;hey, this is supposed to be a site about web development, what&#8217;s all this &#8216;[Chapter 1][1], [Chapter 2][2]&#8230;&#8217; business?&#8221; Well, in case you didn&#8217;t catch the posts (cf. [NaNoWriMo][3]) November is the [National Novel Writing Month][4] and I&#8217;m participating. This of course is taking most of my free time, so I haven&#8217;t had the chance to post much apart from the work I&#8217;m doing on the novel. It&#8217;ll be over soon, but in the meantime enjoy reading [Project: Hydra][5].

In the time that I have had, I&#8217;ve made a few changes and additions to the site, and since most aren&#8217;t obvious I figured I&#8217;d point them out.

1.  I moved the [Project: Hydra][5] links from the Links page to the Archives page.
2.  I added a couple of &#8220;help publicize&#8221; gadgets to the [Subscribe][6] page
3.  I&#8217;ve added a whole load of new plugins, most notably [Gravatars][7] and a [Plugins Used][8] plugin which displays a list of all plugins installed on the site.
