I was on my way to a really important meeting&#8230; <!--more--> OK, OK, if you can read this, it isn&#8217;t April 1st anymore and you missed the joke. On April 1st, 2008, all links on this site pointed to 

[/dashboard.php][1]. Thanks to everyone who was genuinely concerned.

On a side note, life imitated art a little when I changed the site back and the WordPress cache didn&#8217;t know what to do. For a while there, all of the site&#8217;s pages were blank. Good thing I was too busy with work to freak out about it. The cache cycled and everything turned out alright.
