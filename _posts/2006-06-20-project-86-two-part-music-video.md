I listen to a lot of different kinds of music* from [Trance][1] to [Grindcore][2] to Instrumental/New Age to [Post-Hardcore][3] the latter of which [Project 86][4] belongs to. They&#8217;ve just released the second of a two part music video and I just couldn&#8217;t help but post them both here. Enjoy:
