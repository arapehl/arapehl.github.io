Alright so I&#8217;ve started writing my [NaNoWriMo][1] novella. It&#8217;s entitled: &#8220;[Project Hydra][2].&#8221; So far I&#8217;ve got the [Prologue][3](782 words) and a part of the [first chapter][4](1030 words) done. That&#8217;s a total of 1812 words. Not too shabby if I may say so myself.

If you&#8217;re willing to read this as I put it online, I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback. Please remember however that I&#8217;m doing very little editing and even less research. I&#8217;m winging a lot of it and relying heavily on memory and quick internet references. Man, you really learn to appreciate [Google][5]&#8216;s accuracy when you need a quick reference.
