What are your favourite lyrics?

I thought it might be fun for everyone to share what they believe to be their favourite lyrics. I find these to be quite high on my list:

> I took a walk around the world to  
> Ease my troubled mind  
> I left my body laying somewhere  
> In the sands of time
> 
> &#8211;Kryptonite, [3 Doors Down][1]

> I know who I am in the depths of  
> Spirit and truth  
> I&#8217;ve seen the face of redemption  
> And He isn&#8217;t you  
> I&#8217;m through indulging the tastes of  
> My cruelest nature  
> So I think this blade better suits you
> 
> Since we&#8217;re the ones  
> Who occupy this temple  
> We&#8217;ll be the ones  
> Who&#8217;ll show you out
> 
> &#8211;Sincerely Ichabod, [Project 86][2]

So tell me, what are your favourite lyrics?
