[Freebase][1], <q cite="http://www.freebase.com/">the open, shared database of the world&#8217;s knowledge</q> is currently not open or shared because it&#8217;s in private alpha. Which is fine. Except that when I submitted my email address a few days ago for an invite, I wasn&#8217;t expecting to get an email today just to &#8220;shoot the breeze.&#8221;

When I saw that email in my inbox with the subject, &#8220;Thank you for your interest in Freebase.com,&#8221; I thought to myself, &#8220;cool, an invite.&#8221; My excitement turned to puzzlement when I read and read trying to find the invite link or code, or login and just found this:

> We received your email registration. We&#8217;re excited and overwhelmed by the enthusiasm.
> 
> You may be wondering if &#8220;Information Wants to be Free&#8221; why is our Alpha test currently limited? For the time being, we&#8217;re open to a small set of users to get critical feedback. We&#8217;ll use that feedback to make it all a little less &#8216;alpha&#8217;. At that point, we&#8217;ll open up registration to a wider group.

Was this the confirmation email that I was supposed to get when I submitted my address and it was just backlogged for two days? Who knows. Hopefully Freebase will be public soon and none of this will matter.
