  <img id="image275" src="http://arapehlivanian.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/firebug2.png" alt="Firebug Logo" />I promised myself I&#8217;d write a review of <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> while it was still in beta and sadly I never finished it:-(. It seems I&#8217;m still a little behind the curve here, but 2 days ago on the 24th, Firebug came out of beta and took on the full version number 1.0. Congratulations <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe</a>!

In case you&#8217;re wondering what Firebug is, it&#8217;s the best client-side web development tool *ever*. And I&#8217;m not even exaggerating. This jewel allows you a level of insight and control over your HTML, CSS and JavaScript the likes of which you&#8217;ve never seen before, that I can guarantee. And it doesn&#8217;t stop there, it&#8217;s packed with tools like a profiler, http header monitor and more.

Once you&#8217;ve used Firebug you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever managed to built websites without it before.

Oh, and did I mention that it&#8217;s open source and **free**? That shouldn&#8217;t keep you from throwing [a few bucks his way][1] though&#8211;or at least host a [button/link][1]. I mean really, it&#8217;s more than worth it.
